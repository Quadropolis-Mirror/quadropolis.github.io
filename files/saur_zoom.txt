replace your MOUSE2 bind (or whatever key you prefer) with this to enable a simple zoom.

bind "MOUSE2" [fov 25; hudgun 0; maxroll 8; crosshairsize 50; echo "Zoom x4"; onrelease [fov 110; hudgun 1; maxroll 3; crosshairsize 10]]

Note: I'm doing this all from memory; I figured it out yesterday on my home computer, so tell me if
it doesn't work right. I'm not sure I got the default crosshairsize variable right, so check that 
before you add this script. Also, I just added the echo part today. I'm not sure if it will work, so
you can delete it if it doesn't.

Another Note: I have tried to make this zoom feature very balanced. Notice when you go into zoom
you roll is a LOT heavier when you strafe, making it where you almost HAVE TO stand still to make
a hit. This zoom feature was mostly designed for use with the rifle, and has proven to be VERY
effective (not to mention freaking cool!).
