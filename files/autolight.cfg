/echo Autolight script completed!
/echo Made by Megagun with some help from Quin. Thanks go to him.
/echo --------------------------
/echo Lights added most mapmodeltypes. Now please try a calclight, but no /calclight 2 as that also makes mapmodels cast shadows.
/echo ..which is something we don't want as that'd screw things up royally.
/echo Also note that some models need some tweaking in the lights, most notably the 'large' white-flame torch and streetlamps.
/echo Also note that some models aren't supported in this autolightscript, such as computer consoles and the biotank.
/echo All objects whose purpose is to generate lights are supported though.
/echo Please don't run Autolight script again on this map, as it'd create additional lights over preexisting lights!
