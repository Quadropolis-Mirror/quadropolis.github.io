    "author": "TristamK",

    "content": "Welcome\n\nWelcome to Quadropolis, your source and destination for Cube and Sauerbraten content.\nYou can browse through the repositories of mods, maps, and config scripts through the links at the top of the page.\nMore links are present in the side bars to the right,\nfor recent content/comments and site-access according to your status (anonymous, user, moderator).\n\nMake yourself familiar with the different ways to view the communities data.\nThis wild conglomeration was submitted for various types of cube engine -\nfrom Cube (the original) and Assault Cube\nover Sauerbraten, Blood Frontier and Marble Arena\non to Eisenstern.\n\nCube Engines\n\nCube, Sauerbraten, Eisenstern .. if you're confused what this site is about, I go and see the Cube Engine website. All will be revealed there.\n\nContent Types\n\nWe have some guides here,\nbut you should check the wiki for documentation of the engine and - naturally - your local copy of the basic documentation (which includes a static copy of the wiki at release-time).\nMainly the content nodes fall into one of the three sections\n\nMap,\nScript or\nMod\nTaxonomy\n\nThe terms under which we categorize nodes\nFor each of these a number of specific categories might be applicable,\nyou can view certain legitimate combinations via the taxonomy browser -\nbut some combos just don't work that way.\nLike just finding Sauerbraten Deathmatch maps - you'll need to filter the game it's for yourself - e.g. just read over those maps not for Sauerbraten. The only logical operator is AND :-/\nIf you're looking for Capture maps you'd be in luck - they only exist in Sauerbraten,\nCTF maps are just for Assault Cube -\nso in such a case you can slim down on the viewed list to just one subclass of maps.\n\nFlexinode\n\nThe sections content nodes generally fall into\nAnother - more flexible - access to these sections comes via the flexinode module directly;\nFor maps it can display a list, a ranked list or a table.\n\nThese views are also available for Scripts [List Rank Table]\nor Mods [List Rank Table].\n\na list is always sorted by the date the last change occured\na ranked list sorts by stars awarded and subsorts by number of voters\na table can be sorted by any column, initially order will be descending, resort to reverse\n\n \n\nComments and Ratings\n\nIf you would like to rate, comment on, or submit content, then you must create an account for yourself.\nThis requires an existing email address for your default password.\nOnce you are a member, you can rate content by clicking on the \"stars\" at the bottom of the article.\nYour rating will be averaged into the existing rating.\n\nYou can change your rating at any time.\n\nDo not be afraid to do so,\nWiP nodes might one day be of release quality and thus require your judgement to be reevaluated.\n\nNow a word on how to use the 5-star system:\nFirst we got to talk about extremes; of course the ultimate extreme is no rating -\na node that is not worth being rated or too fresh to have received one.\nBut don't leave nodes unrated - tell the author what you think of his work!\n\nIf you rate a node extreme you should leave a comment too, but it's not required;\nit might be hard to vote something 1 star ... but if you have nothing more to say to the author ...\n\nFeel free to rate and comment on any map or mod that you have tried out.\nPlease don't rate content you haven't tested yet - unless the node is malformatted, of course. To avoid getting 1 star for your nodes because people are unhappy with what you posted you should read the packaging guide. Please rate fairly, and consider not only how much you enjoyed the map, but also how well it does what it claims to do in its description - if its only a proof of concept or techdemo map, keep that in mind. That means a map demonstrating a new entity, shader or is just stage for some CubeScript should not be judged by the same aspects as a map intended for being played on.\n\nYou may notice that there is no general purpose forum here at Quadropolis.\nThis site is intended to be for content submission, discussion and review only.\nDiscussion and development of Aardappel's engines should be left to the Cube Forum. Offtopic discussion should be left just about anywhere else.\n\nIn general: if it applies to the node you can ask/answer questions or just shout out your opinion of this node to the viewer. Moderators might have a go at your posting though if they deem it inappropriately phrased, so just stay polite boys-n-gals ;-)\n\n \n\nSubmitting Content\n\nTo do so, click the \"create content\" link in the sidebar. Any regular user can submit maps and config scripts. Maps and scripts will appear in their sections of the site. Moderators can then push the content to the front page if it's impressive enough.\nImproperly formatted, malicious, overbloated, or pointless content will be deleted and your account may be suspended.\nFor more detailed information read the packaging guideline.\n\nMaps\n\nCube and Sauerbraten have excellent facilities for mappers, but it also means that new users can easily make completely pointless maps. Please do not submit your first map, or beta versions of maps, the Quadropolis - this site is intended for complete content that you are proud of.\n\nScreenshots\n\nWhen uploading screenshots, I highly recommend you cut the image up into smaller chunks and combine them into a single image, as exemplified by rocknrol's image below:\n\n\nScripts\n\nIf you have useful scripts, then they can be submitted to Quadropolis as well.\nPlease don't submit single-operation or otherwise oversimplified scripts - that would simply bloat the database. If you have a script, make it as useful and multipurpose as possible - feel free to bundle several scripts together into a pack.\n\nMods\n\nIf you've created a mod, you can submit it to Quadropolis. The term \"mod\" is pretty vague, so generally any modification to Cube (be it content or a new executable, or some total conversion) is generally considered a \"mod\". Quadropolis is intended to be a player-resource first and a developer-resource second, so try to package things in a form that would let them be useful to a player. If you're submitting models or skyboxes, package them with scripts that allow an unskilled player to see them in-game (for example, by optionally including a script to replace an existing piece of existing content with the new content).\n\nStories\n\nIf you have News or a useful Guide for Cube modders or map editors, you can submit it as a story. Note that there is no limited section for News, and that won't likely change, so you need moderator help to get news on to the front page. Guides, on the other hand, have their own section if you've useful information for cube modders and mappers.\n\nOn HTML\n\nAll nodes support a limited subset of HTML.\nThis includes the description blocks of maps/mods/scripts, and the stories. Take advantage of this.\nThe single-large-screenshot allows us to keep our locally-hosted-filesize under control without resorting to more complex systems of file management,\nnot to mention making it simpler to post at least one screenshot of the map.\nHowever, if you want to add some splash or secondary screenshots (hosted externally) to the description, you can.\n\nContent Creators\n\nFor various reasons we restrict the ability to create certain forms of content on Quadropolis. It used to be mods, it's currently stories (and guides) -- too many people were trying to use \"submit story\" to ask for help or request changes. As such, certain users are flagged as \"content creators\" to give them permission to do things like that.\nUse the \"contact admins\" option to request \"content creator\" status, which gives you permission to upload the blocked content. Give us a good sales pitch about whatever you need to do.\n\nOn Moderation\n\nProminent users are made into Moderators on Quadropolis.\nThis gives them the power to vote up/down comments and content on Quadropolis.\nIf something you posted either spontaneously disappears or is bumped to the frontpage, then you can thank a moderator.\nAny content or comments that are deemed to be malicious, malformed, illegal, copyright-infringing, etc. will be removed either by the moderators or by the admins of Quadropolis.\nYou may not get a notice that this has happened.\n \nIf you've been made into a moderator (you might not get notice of that either, you'll suddenly just get a few new options onscreen - we're lazy like that) then please read the Moderators' Guide before abusing your powers.\n \n\nConclusion\n\nThat's our site.\nEnjoy it - take care of it and it will take care of you.\nWe look forward to playing with your crap.",

Then I abandoned all pretense halfway through development and decided it was more important to work on how my map was going to guide the action of the game.\n\nMy hope is that the map encourages a diverse range of playing styles. For example, there is a few places on the map ideal for sniping. However, those places are also open to attack from multiple directions. There also are a couple simple (very simple) jumping puzzles that hopefully reward quick reflexes and dexterity. Getting the quad for instance requires one to look out for enemy fire while focusing on their jumps.\n\nTo sum it up, I hope you enjoy playing my map and thanks!!!\n\n-kerm\n\nMap file blood_mechanic.zip (2.37 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "makkE | 2005-03-16 17:32",
    "image": null,
    "content": "AssaultCube | Guide\n\nI just want to share some knowledge and give some tips on mapping. This is for novice mappers as well as for people that are already familiar with Cube editing. For learning the basics of how to edit maps, refer to the readme.html.\nSome opinions on certain topics might be influenced by my personal taste and views. I don´t claim this were the ways to do it, but it´s the way I do it and what I find important.\n\nSince I have never made a singleplayer map (I like multiplayer better) I can only talk about making multiplayer maps here.\nI will divide this into sections, which are\n\n1. Layout/Performance\n2. Gameplay\n3. Design (detail, mapmodels, light and stuff)\n\n1. Layout/Performance\n\nStarting a new map, it is always good to have some basic concept or idea in mind.\nSometimes I will just start mapping and develop ideas as I go, but often I have an idea, and I will take a piece of paper and get it down first. (sometimes stanze aka lahme, my beloved girlfriend came up with sketches too ;)\n\nSo, while I build the basic layout of the map, I like to keep an eye on the performance, by carefully figuring out where solids are needed to occlude enough of the map to make it enyoyable on most systems.\n\nKeep in mind that if you want the map to have a pretty large open area, you must sacrifice some of the detail, to keep the wqd count reasonable. By \"reasonable\" I mean about 2500-3500 average, tops may reach 5000-5500 but not much more.(the figures given in the readme.html have risen a little since 2001, but be sure to play aard3... it shows that a great map doesn´t need a high wqd-count) Even if you experience no slowdown on your system, please think about those people that don´t have such a pretty high-end machine like you have ;) A lot of people don´t only play cube because it´s cool and free, but also because it has relatively low system requrements.\n\nSince working out the layout in fullbright, or with temporary 16 255 lights (\"l\"-button) will not represent the wqd counts of a fully detailed section of a map, I use to \"spam\" the whole map with small lights (\"2 255\") This way I can get a better picture of how much wqd a special section will have when fully detailed. (turn on \"showmip\" to see what I mean)\n\nI add occluders where they seem neccesairy and this sometimes \"dictates\" the layout in a way, and it just helps to work out and realize the initial layout. This is yet another great thing about cube mapping. Also, a corridor that does a U- or S-turn of some sort, or has a pillar in the middle not only helps performance, but also makes fighting more intresting later !\n\nWhile making the layout, I will try to alter the levels the map has (adding stairs or jumppads). In cube you can´t make a room over a room (with a ceiling dividing both),but if you add different levels to a map and do it good, noone will really notice that ;) Even just slight alterations can spice it up, look at metl3.\n\nAlso keep an eye on architecture itself. Of course, the places where cube happens in are by no means realistic, but some stuff might just look odd to the human eye. As an example, some 8 thick cube ceiling resting on 2 fragile 1 cube wide cube-pillars might look as if it´d tumble down every second.. also, a big building resting on an only 1 cube thick wall will look fragile aswell. And it would furthermore not leave enough room for intresring wall inlays too... in my maps, I try to keep major walls at least 4 cubes thick...\nIn this respect, it´s also a good idea to get the basic layout done first, rather than fully detailing out a room and then make the next one from scratch. At this state it´s still easy to change overall layout...\n\nLet´s get to the basic idea behind the layout. There are basically 3 diffrent \"classical\" types of a Deathmatch-Map layout.\n\nThe \"Arena\" type layout : Maps like aard3, douze, tartech, nudist, kmap5 (and the like) are all centered around one main room/area, and have a rather circular layout. Where ever you go, in the end you will get back to the main area again. This type of layout is very popular, because you won´t get lost easily, and players will learn to navigate the map quite fast.\n\nNext up is what can be called a \"mazy\" layout. Examples are biologie, mak1, powerplant, spillway, infertile, etc.. these maps are generally laid out for a larger number of players. Not being centered arount a main area these maps make sure a lot of individual fighting can commence, without all the players meeting in one place all the time. They rather consist of a series of larger rooms connected by lots of corridors.\n\nThe last type of layout is the \"opposing bases\" layout, that most ctf maps have. These maps are quite symetrical. Of course cube doesn´t have ctf (yet, hopefully), but on a smaller scale, this type of layout can be exellent for 1on1´s, or even for deatmatch. (see minion 1, ogrosupply)\nThe advantages are, that it´s easy to learn the map, and both players have just the same choices in where to go and where to predict/expect the enemy.\n\nOf course, not all of cube´s maps can be categorized in these types, many are a mix of those. metl3 and metl2 are more a blend of \"Arena\" and \"Mazy\" style. After all, not everything you might have in mind will turn out very playable. Try to balance between idea/concept and actual playability.\n\nYou should know what you want gameplay to be like on your map, so it might help to keep these types in mind. This leads us to the most important element in a map:\n\n2.Gameplay\n\nStill a mystery to me and hard to figure out why a map is fun or not, I can only give some basic tips here.\n\nLeave enough space !! This is very important.\nImagine a 50 meter long and 4 cubes wide, 6 cubes high corridor. You are running along it, trying to reach the next room with that valuable armour/health/ammo item in it. you run.. you run..\nHalf way though it, another player enters that corridor from behind, loaded up on ammo, good health and a big armour. The guy/girl starts shooting at you. What can you do? Evade his fire by strafing eradically? No, there´s no space to do that.. Evade his fire/rocket-splash by jumping like a mad kangaroo? Nope, you only bump against the ceiling.. turn around and answer fire? Yep, that´s all you can do, but you´re already dead...\nSee what I mean?\n\nIn that respect, try every corridor to have a good \"headroom\" so players can jump around. Many Cubers just love the high and bunny-like jumping it offers, and use it to be harder to hit, get less of those rocket´s splash damage and to confuse their opponent at close range.\nAlso, let narrow corridors be 8 cubes wide (or six, but no less) so players have a chance to strafe around... There are of course certain situations where this doesn´t have to apply, and it leads us to the next aspect of cube gameplay : Items!!\n\nItem placement is very important for the fun a map can offer. I think there´s two types of items in cube. The ordinary ones (ammo, health,greenarmour) and the powerfull ones (healthboost, quad, yellowarmour)\n\nLet´s take a look at the powerfull ones. These items are very important in order to survive long enough, or to get a lot of frags (quad). Therefore, it´s important to not have them too close to each other. If you make a room that holds the healthboost, quad and yellowarmour at once, gameplay will become a gamble. Whoever is gonna get to that room first can be the dominating player easily. Therefore, it´s better to scatter those items around the map, so everyone has a chance to get a piece of that sweet cake ;)\nAlso, don´t add too much of them. Only one of their kind helps to put the focus on certain areas. Some larger maps might hold 2 healthboosts or 2 greenarmours, but be careful. Do not oversupply the players, it could make it pointless to go to a certain place or not.\n\nIt´s also a good idea to place those important items in places that are a bit risky to reach. If everyone can grab ´em without effort, it´s just luck if you can get em or not.\nThis does mostly apply to the most powerful item, the quad. Look at how the quad is placed in metl1, metl2, douze, inkedskin, tartech... either you have to do a well planned jump (douze, metl1) or you have to go into a dead end (inkedskin/tartech,metl3) or you have to do special jumps like on metl2... this makes sure that getting the quad is some kind of risky, and that players seeing you getting it still have a chance to fight you (If they´re good).\nIt just helps to balance stuff, and make the map more challenging.\n\nAbout the important items: I consider quad the most important, after that yellowarmour, then healthboost. Quad or not is also and important question. Usually a map with quad is more fun, one without is more appealing to the ambitious, competitive player. A quad in a map intended for 1on1 is basically not such a good idea. Good players can have a feeling of when to be there when the next quad spawns (some even count to 60), so the gameplay could rather end up in a \"be there for the quad race\" than some intresting and colourful fight.\n\nMG ammo is a special case. It´s ammo, but by far the most important one. The machinegun in Cube is so powerfull that this is the most important weapon at all.\nEver seen how that ammo is fought over in several maps? Keep that in mind.\n\nAmmo: Ammunition shouldn´t be distributed to generous. As the readme states, try to add it in a way that forces players to move around, and always keep an eye on it. Spamming one room with 4 bullet-entities, 2 packs of rockets, 2 health packs and even more ammo/poweups will invite players to just stay there and frag everyone comming by.\nIt´s also a good idea to put the certain types of ammo where they are most usefull. Put rockets somewhere above (because rockets work best when your opponent is somewhere below). Put shotgun shells where it´s narrow, put the rifle ammo where there´s a lot of space, for example at the start of a large corridor, or open area.\nPut mg ammo wherever there´s large open or mid-distance situations nearby..\nJust try to put the ammo where it makes sense for gameplay. This way you can also give hints to players (like \"look this riflerounds, consider using it, because the next corner will lead you into some large area where you might find it usefull...\")\n\nHealth should be scattered widely across a map. Try to put it so that players that need health will always know where to go to find the next health spot... also putting some just \"along the way\" and some in spots that have to be reached with some effort will spice up gameplay. (see metl3 for example)\n\nHowever you put items in, I think the most important factor is to place them evenly and in a fair manner. If you compare nudist and inkedskin for example, these maps differ a lot when it comes to item placement. Nudist is really full of it, while inkedskin has a very spartanic item placement.\nBoth maps are fun though. Inkedskin is tough because you really have to keep an eye on your ammo and health. In nudist, you´ll run across it all the time, but still nudist is a very intense ffa experience.. both are perfectly balanced... ;)\n\nSpawn Points:\nRule of thumb : The more, the better. Try to add as many as you can. Also, avoid spawnpoints that are in the middle of a room, or a corridor. Spawning and being instantly killed just because being in the line of fire of some other players is frustrating.\nNote to novice mappers. It´s a common mistake to place the spawns with a wrong orientation.\nIf you want to add a spawn in a corner, select the cube you want the spawn to be and fly over it, then add the entity while looking in the desired direction. This holds true for teledest entitiys as well.\n\nI have noticed that the spawnpoints you add first seem to be chosen more frequently for \"random\" spawning. So it´s a good idea to remove all temporary spawns you might have added while building the map, and then add the first ones to be far away from each other, like in the four courners of the map. This way you can make sure that players won´t spawn too much in one area, to a certain extent.\n\n3. Design (detail, mapmodels, light)\n\nDesign is the sugar and spice of maps. The most important factor is to keep it on an even level.\nHaving one room just consisting of ceiling floor and walls, and the other full of heightfields, lamps, floor inlays and mapmodels, will make that room feel out of place.\n\nWhen starting to work out the design and detail, it´s always good to have a theme in mind. Chose what´s going to be your prominent floor, wall and ceiling textures, and use the replace feature at first to get your map into a general theme. Also , orienting on the diffrent pack´s themes is a good idea. Some maps happen to combine a lot of styles (like cellar, exellent mix of themes) but it´s easier to go with those that fit together naturally (themes are generally \"tech/base\" (metl3, tartech, powerplant,mak2,ogrosupply, darth etc) \"egypt\" (nudist, gzdm1, metl1 etc) \"midevial\" (metl1, b2k, most maps that feature the new dg textures, and the \"bricky\"-kind (aard3, gib, inkedskin, douze...)\n\nThere are some diffrences between the textures of a certain pack. Some are to be used on a large scale, others arent, they are \"trim\" textures, and shouldn´t be used on large walls or floors, because they can become too repetitive.\n\nIt´s usually better go go around the map and add detail step by step. First you might concentrate on the basic Architecture, such as pillars, arches, the way your stairs and jumppads look. Try to find some good trim textures, and use em throughout the map. Add other \"simple\" architectural elements, like windows, additional arches or ceiling work, etc... go step by step, this will help to get a certain amount of consistency in design. While doing so, keep an eye on how wqd rises, to find out how detailed you can go.\nAfter that, you can start to add diversity. Try to make certain areas recognizeable, either by adding unique elements, or by\nslightly changing the textures used. Keep some things same throughout the map (preferred trims or lights/lamps) so a new room\nwill still feel like part of the same building.. This will help the player to learn the map faster, and to know where he is.\nBad examples are mak1 and q3dm2 both use far to many diffrent textures in my opinion. I don´t like em at all anymore...\n\nLight: Important : do not use the \"l\" button everywhere. In cube, usually smaller light sources lead to better results, because they will add more contrast. Of course it´s faster to add some big light sources, but you can always bind some keys to \"/newent light x x\" ;)\n\nBig light sources tend to blurr the textures and make it all appear a little bland. A more contrasting lightning will always be more visually appealing.\nThis is pretty much a matter of taste though. The most important rule should be (imho) that there has to be a visible diffrence between fullbright and lit.\nTake a look at how maps you like are being lit, and learn from that.\n\nThough cube´s lightning doesn´t produce shadows like they would naturally appear, you can still add a kind of realism to places. Outdoor areas can use bigger lightsources, while corridors and indoor rooms benefit from more contrast lightning. There are a lot of special \"lamp\" textures you can use on the ceilings and walls or even floors, in addition to small \"highlights\" they can add both detail and interesting light to indoor rooms...\n\nColoured lights: When adding coloured lights, be careful. Some textures can become bland if exposed to certain colours. If you add a yellow light to an egypt style map, the yellow will wash out the subtle shades of yellow/brown in the texture.\nAlso make sure you keep a consistent colour theme. Don´t add a red, a blue and a yellow light to the same area...\nGood examples of coloured light are infertile (note how the red fog and red lights add to create a unique atmosphere), and minion1, where the slight blue in the lights help to crate a literally cool atmosphere and make the blue textures shine a little more, without washing them out) Metl3 is outstanding in using subtle colour to add fine variation to the textures.\n\nMapmodels:\nYou should add them after all is done, not sooner. After the 2004 release with all of dcp´s great mapmodels, there were a lot of maps done that used the mapmodels to add detail in a considerably bland environment. There are so many possibilities to add detail to a map without them. Be sure to have maxed out the architectural possibilities of cube(and your map) before adding them, only as \"super extra spice\". There´s nothing more boring than a map that looks empty after a \"/clearents mapmodel\"...\n\nBe careful with the surrounding lights. Mapmodels will light up using only the amount of light of the cube they rest on. Try to adjust, especially when using architectural stuff. It might be hard to adjust a big pile of barrels to each other without\ngetting undesired effects on the sourrounding architecture, but you shouldn´t use large amounts of mapmodels anyways. Repetition will make look things boring.\n\nLook at all the older maps, especially those from goetz and metl... it doesn´t take lots of mapmodels to make things interesting ;) And when you put them in, be sure to avoid repetition. They will lose their magic...\n\nThis is about all advice I can think of giving right now. Hope it helps somebody. Generally, take a look at your favourite maps and try to figure out what makes ´em so good, whether it´s design or gameplay.\n\nYou might also want to check out this intresting article:\n\nhttp://www.cliffyb.com/art-sci-ld.html\n\nand recently these two previews of chapters have popped up:\nhttp://book.hourences.com/booklighting.htm\nand\nhttp://book.hourences.com/bookgameplay.htm\n\nlogin to post comments",

Originally designed as a CTF map, it plays out rather well in FFA and other weapon-ful modes. Not so great for instagib or any of the fist-only modes.\n\nEach fort is comprised of multiple floors. The basement level consists of a short hallway and staircase leading up from the sewer as well as an underwater tunnel leading to a grate-covered pit visible from above on the first floor. The first floor spans the entire fort, is accessible via staircases from the basement and second floor as well as front and back doors leading outside, contains two playerstart positions, and provides excellent visibility of the 3 other floors as well as the outdoors through large windows. The second floor is reached via two staircases and holds most of the ammo inside the fort, as well as a green armor. It provides access to the upstairs windows and the rear balcony as well as a jumppad to the third floor, and has good visibility of most of the first and third floors and the outdoors. The third floor is reachable only via jumppad or rocket jump and contains a healthboost. The third floor also provides the ideal location for flag placement in CTF mods.\n\nOutside the forts there is a large open area punctuated by a chain of platforms leading from the corners to the center, providing access to the yellow armor, healthboost, and quad. Also located outside are two sniper towers accessible via jumppad at their bases, and a wall around the edge of the zone. Visibility ranges from moderate to excellent, including into the first floors of the forts. Ammo and health is generously distributed.\n\nBelow the map lie sewers. The sewers are accessible via two staircases near the center of the map, and two staircases down from the first floors of the forts. They are also visible through grates in the map corners and above the pits inside the forts. Two playerstart positions are placed in the sewers, as well as health and ammo, with two yellow armor items in the pits under the forts.\n\nWQD gets up to 5500 due to very few occluding walls, with an average of around 3500. Also to be noted is WVT from 3500 to 14000 and EVT from 13000 to 100000. A large number of mapmodels on this map, mostly neccessary for architecture, leads to lower than expected FPS. LOD adjustments can help, but not to the same extent as on a cube-only map.\n\nPlease note that this map cannot be used as-is in Quad CTF because of Quad's replacement jumppad mapmodel and incorrect handling of stacked Bridge mapmodels.\n\nMap file 2fort-128.zip (6.57 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube | Deathmatch | CTF | Large (9-15)\nBlurb Two opposing fortresses, complete with sewer tunnels and watchtowers. Large Map.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (62KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThis map is symmetric, with two identical forts facing each other. Originally designed as a 5v5 or larger CTF map, it plays ok in DM modes with enough players (10+).\n\nEach fort is comprised of multiple floors. The basement level consists of a short hallway and staircase leading up from the sewer as well as an underwater tunnel leading to a grate-covered pit visible from above on the first floor. The first floor spans the entire fort, is accessible via staircases from the basement and second floor as well as front and back doors leading outside, contains two playerstart positions, and provides excellent visibility of the 3 other floors as well as the outdoors through large windows. The second floor is reached via two staircases and holds most of the ammo inside the fort, as well as a green armor. It provides access to the upstairs windows and the rear balcony as well as a jumppad to the third floor, and has good visibility of most of the first and third floors and the outdoors. The third floor is reachable only via jumppad or rocket jump and contains a healthboost. The third floor also provides the ideal location for flag placement in CTF mods.\n\nOutside the forts there is a very large outdoor area comprised of a simple maze. Series of platforms lead from the corners of the map up to the middle to acquire the quad, with health boosts placed along the way. Also located outside are two sniper towers accessible via jumppad at their bases. One playerstart position is placed at the base of each tower. Visibility ranges from poor to excellent, including into the first floors of the forts. Ammo and health is generously distributed.\n\nBelow the map lie sewers, both lit and unlit. The sewers are accessible via staircases within the forts, outside the forts, and at the base of each tower. They are also visible through grates in the ground outside and above the pits inside the forts. Two playerstart positions are placed in the sewers, as well as health and ammo, with two yellow armors in the pits under the forts.\n\nWQD gets up to 10000 due to very few occluding walls, with an average of around 3500. A large number of mapmodels on this map, mostly neccessary for architecture, leads to lower than expected FPS. LOD adjustments can help, but not to the same extent as on a cube-only map.\n\nPlease note that this map cannot be used as-is in Quad CTF because of Quad's replacement jumppad mapmodel and incorrect handling of stacked Bridge mapmodels.\n\nMap file 2fort-256.zip (10.86 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

The geometry is accurate to within half a cube (to the map's fully-triggered configuration) everywhere that Cube's design allows, with exceptions for the box stacks and the diagonal hallways. Texturing is unfortunatly not as precise.\n\n8 playerstart positions make respawn frags less common than in most DM maps this simple. Every weapon, along with armor and the quad, is available in the central room, at the risk of high exposure. Extra shotgun shells and health packs are arranged along the outer rooms and hallways.\n\nLighting in this map is rather detailed, resulting in WQD as high as 7500 with default settings.

Eqyptian themed, with slight room over room. The conversion is about 80% accurate. Geometry changes include omission of one-cube floor and ceiling edging, slightly longer hallways (to eliminate room over room in favor of perpendicular hallway over hallway), and slight changes in some corner shapes to allow for Cube's tricky corner rendering. Entity placement is effectively arbitrary, with only a little ammo and the Quad remaining in place, due to the disparity between Quake's available items as well as Cube's lack of multiplayer triggers.\n\nThe map plays well with 2-4 players. It is 'smaller' than it looks due to three teleports making it far more connected than it would seem at first. There are no dead ends, with at least two ways out of every room.\n\nMap file ultrav.zip (3.82 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Not much remains of this past. One advancement forever changed the nature of Ogro civilization... gunpowder. Art, science and culture were all cast aside as the Ogro people focused all of their attention on shooting one another.\n\nThere is evidence of this change all around. Weapons and ammunition lie scattered about the site. It would seem that the ancient Ogros who built these structures annihilated themselves in a final fierce battle. But then, in the distance you hear a gunshot... you pick up a shotgun laying nearby and can only hope that after all this time it still works...\n\nOk, enough silly intro. My goal with this map (aside from learning most of the editing features of cube) was to create a fairly convincing outdoor map that felt very open (less like the more common 4-walled courtyard) with detailed, recognizable features.\n\nIt's a fairly large map. So unless you like the hunter/hide-and-seek type game you probably will want to start with about 4 players. I think it would probably scale up to about 12 to 16 for faster-paced games. I also think it works pretty well for instagib.\n\nThanks to everyone who indulged me and test-played the map over the last few days and gave me feedback.\n\nEnjoy and let me know what you think of it.\n\nMap file templemount.zip (11.55 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I just went through some of our more prolific and notable contributors and have given them moderator access. It doesn't really matter a whole lot - pretty much most decisions you make as a moderator need to be reinforced by a second moderator before they take direct effect. At any rate:\n\nMakkE, Shadow, Staffy, MitaMAN, Dplomat, and Sparr are now moderators. There's no additional responsability - you can totally ignore the priviledges if you like. All they can do is moderate up and down comments and help move stuff to the front page. Please read the moderators' guide before using your mod access.\n\nThis is just experimental and not a big deal - the worst I'll do if it doesn't work out is change the moderator access or remove it altogether - but I'm sure it will be useful.",

As such, it was a pretty massive overhaul. It's very symmetrical, essential one big columned room with a chasm in the middle. There are three basic ways to get into the enemy territory- use jumppads to jump across the chasm, run up tunnels from the bottome of the chasm, or (the recent addition, and probably easiest way) use teleports to get into the corners of enemy territory.\n\nA note about the corners- they're the only place you can bring the WQD count up to 4000 (as far as my testing shows, anyhoo). And this only happens when you have two more of the corners in your FOV. If you're noticing this you obviously aren't playing hard enough.\n\nI made a custom skybox for this map, but again decided not to include it in this zip. I picked emerald as a replacement, but it's just not as good.

    "content": "Cube | Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Other Mod | Obsolete | Guide\nThis content is compatible with older edition(s) of the game it was made for, and is not guaranteed to work with the current or development versions.\n\nIn this small tutorial I will try to explain how to use Blender v2.36 with the Quake 2 modeller to produce and texture a simple mesh for use with Cube.\n\nDisclaimer: I can't guarantee that the tutorial will be of any use to anyone. If you arise damages from the tutorial, I don't want to know about it.\n\nWhat we need:\n\nBlender 2.36 and the Blender md2 import/export scripts by Bob Holcomb\n(script files must be put in the .blender/scripts folder in order to work)\n\nThe Quake 2 modeller by Phillip Martin and Jaimi McEntire (hopefully v0.91b)\n\nFirst let's start by creating a cube in Blender. I assume you have some basic knowledge on how to use this program, otherwise from now on it may be a little hard to follow. Place the cursor in a 3D View window, hit spacebar and select add=>mesh=>cube. In edit mode, press A to select all if needed (not needed in our case because all is selected by default, but good to know anyway), then click the Mesh menu and select faces=>convert quads to triangles. Use keypad 1, 3 and 7 or SHIFT + the latter to change top and side views. Keypad 5 switches between perspective and orthogonal view. Once you've chosen a view enter UV face select mode and press U. Choose Bounds to 1/1 or experiment with other options. When you've made your choice enter the UV/Image editor window, select an image, go back to 3D view, enter Object mode and press ALT+Z to see your model textured. If you have difficulty with all those hotkeys look for corresponding commands in the menus, personally in most cases I find it more convenient to use a hotkey.\n\nAfter you export the mesh, open the .md2 file with Quake 2 modeller. You need to have UV mapped the mesh in Blender even if you didn't select a texture, otherwise it may not load properly. Select, move, scale, manage frames, export to md2 and try with Cube.\n\nThis way of producing Cube model data is not very reliable. Nonetheless, I think the information presented here or parts of it may be useful to Cube people.\n\nSinsky\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube | Obsolete | Mapping | Other License\nThis content is compatible with older edition(s) of the game it was made for, and is not guaranteed to work with the current or development versions.\nBlurb A simple script to aid you when you are making stairs.\nDetailed description\n\nStairs are a simple and very useful structure. Many maps have stairs. Some maps have a lot of stairs. Some maps have small stairs, others have big stairs.\n\nHowever, there is nothing as boring as making stairs manually, step by step...\n\nI wrote this little script to solve this problem. With this script, creating stairs is (almost) as simple as running one command on console.\n\nHow to use:\n\nSelect the area on map where you want your stairs.\nProbably you will want to make it flat. Use . (dot) and/or , (comma).\nType: /stairsx step inc, where step is the width of each step, and inc is the height of each step.\nDone.\n\nDetailed description:\n\nType /stairshelp to show a little in-game help about this script.\nUse /stairsx to make stairs on \"x\" axis, or use /stairsy to make stairs on \"y\" axis\nThis script is able to make stairs both on floor and on ceiling. It will make it on floor if you are look at floor, or on ceiling, if you are looking at ceiling.\nThe step parameter must be greater or equal to 1. The inc parameter, however, can be positive or negative. If you try to use this script to make a left-right stairs, but get a right-left one, try to invert the inc signal.\nAfter running this script, your old selection will be lost.\nYou can't easily undo the modifications of script. undo command will undo one step per time. This can be boring if there are a lot of steps. A faster way will be re-select then entire stairs area and flatten it.\nWhen you use negative inc on floor or positive inc on ceiling, the stairs will be \"sunken\" on floor/ceiling. This is intentional. You must re-select the entire stairs and raise/lower it as you want.\nThis script just executes some commands which will generate stairs if executed on a flat ground. If the ground is not flat, the results may not look like stairs, but may be still interesting. For example, if you superimpose \"stairsx\" and \"stairsy\", it will look like a Q-Bert level.\n\nI accept feedback, but I don't plan to add more features to it. I want to keep it simple.\n\nI would like to know if there is any way to make \"local variables\" in Cube scripting, or some way of \"removing\" an alias.\n\nJust one final note: do not abuse of this script, and do not use only this script to make your stairs. Add little details by yourself to make your map look better.\n\nPreview\n// Config script\n\nConfig file stairs.txt (715 bytes)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "News\n\nAs you may or may not have noticed, the new version of Drupal (the CMS backend of the site) has some problems. Really, we would've just left the old version, but there was a serious security weakness.\n\nAt any rate, the complaint is usually the layout missing some crucial elements (like the login box, or the \"maps\" entry in the content type list) - just refresh your browser and the problems seem to go away.\n\nIf there are any unsolvable problems, use the \"contact admins\" or comment on this thread and we'll try to work it out.\n\nWe apologise for the inconvenience.\n\nEdit: on further inspection, it may have to do with the \"throttle\" system. Likely the new version improved \"throttle\"'s sensitivity. This module converts the site into a lower-bandwidth form when the load is heavy. While I'm not positive that this is the source of the problem, it means that said features are disabled when too many users are hitting the site. Dunno how to tweak it to work better. More as it develops.\n\nlogin to post comments",

I received an offer through the feedback system, listed below:\n\n-- The following message was sent using the feedback page --\n\nHi\n\nMy Name is Ian Clark and I am doing a College business project using\nCube. This project will hopefull make money and I will continue to run\nit after the class ends. I have been looking into the copyright issue\nand it seems that most of the textures are or might be copyrighted. I\nseem to have run across the same problem that some members of your\ncommunity have, that it is very diffucullt to tell what one can or\ncannot use within cube. So what I am looking for are 4 or 5 Cube levels\nsuitalbe for 4-7 players (multiplayer) made with original textures, and\nhave an original look. I am willing to pay 50-100$ US each and it would\nbe for a non-exclusive commercial license meaning that the person would\njust be giving me permission to use it. I know that it is not a lot but\nat least it is some extra cash for their hard work. We are trying our\nbest not to rip off anything from cube, and customers will not have to\npay for the game we will make our profits with other methods. It is our\ngoal to make a business to bring cube and sauer to the next level and\ngive back as much as we can to the community.\n\nThank you for your time and if you could send some people my way, or put a post on the site I would be forever greatful\n\nThanks\n\nIan Clark\n\n\n\n----------------------------------\nSite Name : Quadropolis\nRegistered name : Clark\nFull Name : Ian Clark\nE-mail address : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nReferring page : http://www.quadropolis.us/\nIP Address : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nBrowser info : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1\n\n\nAnyone interested in taking him up on his offer, use the \"admin feedback\" to request his email address (unless you're reading this Ian, and you want me to post your address publicly).\n\nFYI to Ian, I think the models may also be a problem - I don't know that they're usable for retail gaming, which is what it sounds like your project is. You'll have to look into the licenses for the MD2s packaged with Cube - they may be \"free use only\". However, MD2s are easily swappable for other md2s, so if you can find any that are usable for any application (not just freeware) then you can just drop them in place of the existing models.\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube | Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Obsolete | Source mod | Windows\nThis content is compatible with older edition(s) of the game it was made for, and is not guaranteed to work with the current or development versions.\nBlurb Play Cube or Sauerbraten console-style from the comfort of your couch...\nScreenshot \nGet original file (56KB)\nDetailed description\n\n\n\nUPDATED 5/25/2006\n- Updated to be compatible with the 04/26/06 build of Sauerbraten.\n- Fixed typo in keymap.cfg that was causing binding errors.\n\nUPDATED 4/05/2006\n- Added menu-driven joystick configuration. See below for details.\n\nUPDATED 3/29/2006\n- Added the joyshowevents property. See below for details.\n- Also, verified that the mod works with non-analog sticks.\n\nUPDATED 3/25/2006\nThis mod now contains executables for both Sauerbraten and Cube.\n\nWhy would you do this?\nJust for kicks I thought I would see if I could set up game controller support for sauerbraten. I know most serious PC gamers would never dream of giving up the mouse. Personally, I sometimes get tired of being hunched over the computer and find it relaxing to sit back on the couch and play console-style. So if you've got a laptop with support for TV-output and a pc game controller with at least one stick (preferably analog) on it you might give this a shot.\n\nHow it works:\nBasically, I took the approach that I would intercept joystick events and translate them into sauerbraten keypress events. This allows joystick events to be \"bound\" to actions like you would any other keyboard or mouse event.\n\nConfig File Settings\nI added the following variables to the config.cfg to configure the joystick:\n\njoyfovxaxis / joyfovyaxis\nThis setting specifies which stick should control the field of view (what the mouse does for you now). Each stick has a horizontal and a vertical axis. Each axis is numbered starting with 1. So, for example, on my controller, which is very similar to the one pictured above, if I wanted the use the left stick the settings would be:\n\njoyfovxaxis 1\njoyfovyaxis 2\n\nor\n\njoyfovxaxis 2\njoyfovyaxis 1\n\ndepending on how your controller numbers the axes.\n\nIf you wanted to use the right one (recommended) the settings would be:\n\njoyfovxaxis 3\njoyfovyaxis 4\n\nor\n\njoyfovxaxis 3\njoyfovyaxis 4\n\n\njoyfovinvert\nSpecifies how the stick controls your field of view. If set to 0 you will look in the direction you press on the stick. If set to 1 (inverted) the control works like a flight simulator: pull back on the stick to nose up, push forward to nose down. This is the default.\n\njoyaxisminmove\nThis property sets up the minimum amount of movement that is required to trigger an event when binding axis movements to actions. The range for this setting is 1-30. If set to 1 you basically just have to breath hard on the stick and it will trigger the event. If set to 30 you'll have to push it practically to the edge. The default is 8.\n\njoysensitivity\nThis is the property you'll probably end up tweaking the most. On certain maps where you're getting really low fps you might need to bump this up a bit. The range for this setting is 1-10 where 1 is the least sensitive and 10 is the most. Remember, these values can be set from within the game. Just type /joysensitivity n at the console to bump the sensitivity up or down, or better yet, create an alias and map this to a couple of your joystick buttons. (See the response below titled \"Joystick Sensitivity Script\" for an example of how to do this.)\n\njoyshowevents\nThis property is meant to be used when configuring your game controller. When joyshowevents is set to 1, all joystick events will be displayed in the console. This will help you determine which button to use when binding actions to the joystick, as well as which axis to use for movement and field of view control.\n\nFor example, if you want to use a certain button to fire your gun, press that button and you will see something like this displayed in the console:\n\nJOYBUTTON7: DOWN\nJOYBUTTON7: UP\n\nYou can then bind that button from within the game by typing:\n\n/bind JOYBUTTON7 [attack]\n\n(Binding joystick events is discussed further in the next section.)\n\nThis is also useful for configuring the field of view axis. In this case you just move the axis to the left and right and then up and down. This will display which axes are being moved which you can use to set the joyfovxaxis and joyfovyaxis values.\n\nBinding Joystick Events\nThere are currently three types of joystick events you can bind to actions:\n\nBinding Buttons\nI've left space for up to 20 joystick buttons that can be bound to the action of your choice. For example, I wanted to map \"attack/shoot\" to my right trigger finger button, and \"jump\" to the trigger finger on the left. On my controller the right trigger button is button 8 and the left trigger button is button 7, so I added the following lines to my config.cfg file:\n\nbind \"JOYBUTTON8\" [attack]\nbind \"JOYBUTTON7\" [jump]\n\n\nBinding Stick Movements\nI've left space for up to 5 sticks (10 total axes) that can be bound to actions. Like in the picture above I wanted to use the left stick to control my movement: push forward on the stick to move forward, back to move backward, right and left to strafe. So, I added the following lines:\n\nbind \"JOYAXIS1MIN\" [left]\nbind \"JOYAXIS1MAX\" [right]\nbind \"JOYAXIS2MIN\" [forward]\nbind \"JOYAXIS2MAX\" [backward]\n\n\nBinding Pad Movements\nSome controllers, like the one in the picture above, have those little up/down/left/right \"pad\" or \"hat\" controls. In the picture above I have up mapped to zoom-in and down mapped to zoom-out. The binding for that would look like this:\n\nbind \"JOYHAT1NORTH\" [fov 15; crosshairsize 50]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SOUTH\" [fov 110; crosshairsize 22]\n\nYou could also use that pad for controlling your movement. That would look like this:\n\nbind \"JOYHAT1NORTH\" [forward]\nbind \"JOYHAT1NE\" [forward; right]\nbind \"JOYHAT1EAST\" [right]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SE\" [backward; right]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SOUTH\" [backward]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SW\" [backward; left]\nbind \"JOYHAT1WEST\" [left]\nbind \"JOYHAT1NW\" [forward; left]\n\n\nMenu Configuration\nSauerbraten users can now configure joysticks using the much more intuitive menu-driven interface. Simply navigate to the joystick menu under options->joystick (If you do not see the images below go here):\n\nThe following screen will be displayed:\n\nFrom this menu you can configure all of the joystick settings. The example above shows the user changing the joystick axis used for looking left and right. The example below shows the user selecting an action for a button:\n\nI recommend that you first set \"show events\" to \"yes\" before setting the other properties. This will cause the joystick events to be displayed in the console as buttons are pressed or axes are moved. This should help when deciding which button, pad or axis to use with each setting or action.\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nThis is built from the 4/26/06 release for Sauerbraten and the 8/29/2005 release for Cube.\nThis works for all(2) of my controllers. I do not know if it will work for you. (Please try it out and let me know.)\nIf your game controller does not have at least one stick, this will not work.\nThis supports only one game controller. If you have more than one connected, I'm just going to take the first one I find.\nIf no game controller is recognized, or the game controller cannot be initialized for whatever reason there will be no notification, sauerbraten will just load as normal.\nI have not tried this on linux yet.\nNote to Cube Players: Because of cheat protection built into Cube, modified clients cannot connect to official release servers. So if you want to play online with others you'll have to start up a server using the executable included.\nNote to Cube Players: The menu-driven configuration is currently only available for Sauerbraten. If there is enough interest I can back-port this feature to Cube.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n- dbox\n\nMod file sauerjoy.zip (261.96 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

During this war the human race built a base of operations in the close small Avarax planet, and with it the Feather War Factory, destined to supply the soldiers with vehicles, equipment and of course, weapons.\n\nAfter the war finished, the Feather War Factory had some legal issues and went down like an extinct eagle. The factory closed, and the owner, desperated and without money, heard about this so called \"deathmatch arenas\", so he supplied the processing and storage facility of the factory (aka KatreZ) for deathmacth matches.\n\nNotes:\nI started building this map long ago, when I downloaded the 2002 release, this month I found out that Cube is still alive, so I downloaded the last version and arranged and improved a lot of the map. So here it is, finally finished, it has no custom textures or mapmodels, but it does have a custom skyboy courtesy of Mighty Pete. WQD goes up to 5000 in the two higher parts, but no more than that, the rest is between 200-2000.\nThat is all, have fun with it. If you happen to find any bug, please report it to my mail (ReadMe file).\n\nUpdate v1.1:\nFixed some really minimal things, I think you won't even notice them, but I'm uploading it anyway. :P\n\nUpdate v1.2:\nYet another deluxe edition for my cube maps, last one I hope. Just like with Lifepool, I've detailed it with Sauerbraten's modifications and textures, and also, as a bonus, I've re-edited the lightning since I didn't like it, think it looks better now.\n\nMap file KatreZ_v1.2.zip (441.02 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Deathmatch | Large (9-15)\nBlurb The Feather War Factory's storage and processing facility.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (0KB)\nDetailed description\n\nMap's Story:\nLong ago, before the deathmatch was considered as a legal sport, a war raging for conquer Identi planet took place in the Estrada system. During this war the human race built a base of operations in the close small Avarax planet, and with it the Feather War Factory, destined to supply the soldiers with vehicles, equipment and of course, weapons.\n\nAfter the war finished, the Feather War Factory had some legal issues and went down like an extinct eagle. The factory closed, and the owner, desperated and without money, heard about this so called \"deathmatch arenas\", so he supplied the processing and storage facility of the factory (aka KatreZ) for deathmacth matches.\n\nNotes:\nThis is it. I've finished porting the map, I added a lot of detail and corrected a lot of things that were bad. Using some home made textures (With paint :P) I've added a lot of life to it.\nOriginally I made two versions of the map, one for daylight and another for night ilumination. The daylight one got into the last oficial Sauerbraten release (And I couldn't be happier), so I'm releasing this one for those that want it this way, it's always nice to have the choice.\n\nWhat I want now is all the feedback you can throw me, also you can critic the daylight version right here.\n\nAgain, enjoy this map, gimme feedback, and good luck!\n\nUpdate v2.1:\nHere it is, the hopefully final version of KatreZ, this update fixes some minimal graphical bugs I saw in the last version. Also I've modified some places I didn't like, I think this is as good as I want it to be. Again, any feedback is totally apreciated and have fun playing this one.\n\nUpdate v2.2:\nWhen I say final version, I don't really mean it, since I'm always modifying my creations. This new version is updated to the last release of Sauerbraten (09-12-06), it includes some fixes that misteriously appeared in the last versions of Sauer. I've deleted textures that were useless, so the file weights less, there's some gameplay fixes, and some graphical details. Hope you enjoy it. Next version will hopefully have bumpmaps and more detail. Day version has been submitted for the next Sauer release.\n\nMap file KatreZ_Dark_Night_v2.2.zip (1.02 MB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Nevertheless I intend to upgrade the keyboard-layouts still further, but need to do some more mapping time to find out what's needed.\n\nAny suggestions are more than welcome and I'd be happy to oblige your requests for new functionality.\n\nLook for \"lite\" edition : size 526K shrinks down to 19K\nhttp://count0.dyndns.org/sauerbraten/meatpak/meATpAk_v0.5_lite_20060514.zip\n\nConfig file meATpAk_v0.5_20060514.zip (527.16 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Guide\n\nAre you planning to upload some content to Quadropolis - Great! Read on!\nThe Cube Wiki article Distributing Maps contains the original text of this guide;\nThis deals with the specifics of Quadropolis postings.\nIt tries to prepare you for providing poished content to the community and avoid any unwanted tags, maybe even get you a starred content one. ;-)\n\nContent\n\nApart from the must-read part on proper packaging there's a lot more information on this topic, feel free to read those at your leisure.\n\nQuadropolis Nodes - for the technically inclined\nUse ZIP files - the default argument\ncorrect ZIPping - the must read\nOS look-out-for's - operating system caveats\noptional content - the nice to have elements\n\n\nMake a good screenshot - both for the node as for games that use it in-game\nHave a README - why have one, what to call and where to put it\nHave a Way-Point file - why have one, what to call and where to put it\nBeware of OS caveats - the most common problems\n\nQuadropolis Nodes\n\nQuadropolis uses a number of paradigms to serve differently formatted media-packages for Cube Engine games of a number of flavours;\n\nThe top-level paradigm \"node\" is wether your media is a Map - this might need to include more than the actual *.cgz, *.ogz or whatever extension your MOD uses, actually - or whether it's a MOD - that might mean anything from some basic content modding up to a full-blown total-conversion - or if it's a Script addon.\nThe Scripts currently might need to be refactored; while they were actually thought for CubeScript Only there's a number of early nodes there that should be MODs - please put non-CubeScript scripts into MODs yourself, thanks!\n\nThe node paradigm results in a type-specific container which will hold a number of attributes.\nSo you will want to present users with a screenshot of your map or mod .. but traditionally scripts don't have one.\nmaps will want to be categorized by the different gamemodes (e.g. a Capture-only map or even a gamemode only available in a quadropolis supported mod (e.g. CTF for AC)), or size (for 4 players, 16 players ..).\nA mod will need to flag the operating-systems it's for.\nPlease take care when filling out the form for an upload - incorrect settings here are often reason for complaint, really pick the right choice/choices for each field! Especially Licensing has repeatedly been assigned incorrect values.\n\nDon't forget to check display of your new node, e.g. after having logged out .. to see it's showing up everything;\nyou can always click on \"edit\" when viewing nodes you posted (of course being logged in again),\nand fix up any or all the field settings .. if you want to update your node with a new file for example :)\n\nUse ZIP files\n\nEven if it's just a single map!\nDo not use any other packaging software; ZIP is universally available.\n\nAlways package content so that it can be extracted directly into the installation folder;\nthis explains why even a single map file should be zipped (they should be in the subfolder packages/base/ inside the ZIP (or equivalent for non-sauerbraten games))... maybe the only exception to this zipping rule would be a very simple script - one that will either be called directly from autoexec.cfg (or even be copied into it), since they would best be placed directly in the installation folder anyway.\n\nDon't replace content! There is always a way to make your content sit side-by-side with the regular stuff,\nif you actually do need to replace stuff (models come to mind) then just add information about how to switch to and fro in your README.\n\ncorrect ZIPping\n\nRemove all cruft from it too before uploading, just the content and a readme should be in it.\nDon't include any hidden files of your system ... like those Windows and MacOS like to create - but *Nix users should watch out too! Remove them from the ZIP-file after zipping if you can't prevent them from going in in the first place. Also do not name your ZIP-file packages.zip.\nA good naming convention can be:\nFor a map called The Arena Of Splatz, filename: splatza would work very well as splatza2345aug31.zip with\n\npackages/base/splatza.ogz\npackages/base/splatza.cfg\npackages/base/splatza.jpg\npackages/textures/splatza/textures.cfg\npackages/textures/splatza/sign02.png\npackages/textures/splatza/team_red.png\npackages/textures/splatza/team_blue.png\npackages/models/mapmodels/splatza/lamp/tris.md5\npackages/models/mapmodels/splatza/lamp/skin.png\npackages/models/mapmodels/splatza/lamp/md5.cfg\npackages/sounds/mapsounds/splatza/sounds.cfg\npackages/sounds/mapsounds/splatza/near_flag.ogg\n\n\nYour ZIP should be structured something like this:\n\nor see a fully expanded version.\n\noperating system (OS) look out for stuff\n*Nix\n\nOn linux I can recommend using a file with a line for each part to be included in the zip and then\ncalling something like zip -r my_upload.zip -i@my_files ./ from the installation folder.\n\nWindows\n\nOn Windows XP (or later) ZIP is integrated into your FileManager (Explorer).\nUnless you're using a more elaborate GUI capable of compressing into classic WinZIP format I'd suggest the following procedure to create a clean upload:\n\nCreate a folder for your download - imagine this to be the folder sauerbraten is installed into;\nplace a README_theFileName.[html/txt] into this folder.\nDepending on what you are distributing you should add appropriate subfolders like packages/theFileName or packages/base and/or whatever needs to be added to a vanilla sauerbraten installation to use your upload.\nWhen everything is in place go to the folder with your README and mark everything (Ctrl + A),\nthen right-click on the README and \"send to ZIP-compressed folder\".\nApple\n\nFor MacOS the following programs have been mentioned on the forum.\n\nThanks to Halleck\nMacZipIt, which seems to work well via simple drag-n-drop.\nThanks to MovingTarget\narticle about dot_clean in the hope Mac users will find it useful.\nOnly once and I have not heard any feedback about it - clean archive.\n\nNice To Have\n\nThese aspects may be optional and/or required - this depends largely on the target engine, but can also be due to the very nature of your node;\nyou should have some good idea of what would go as using common sense simply by examining other nodes on quadropolis - pick one w/o packaging issues and with probably highly rated content, don't just rely on one ZIP though - examine as many as you can.\n\nMake a good screenshot\n\nFor content nodes that require a screenshot please take some care in creating it.\nTake a look at the subline of the screenshot-form-element in the upload-form to see current limitations,\nat the time of writing these were 1024 KB maximum file-size and 640x480 maximum dimensions.\nJPG or PNG should be the formats of choice and reducing file-size as much as possible a courtesy to the community :)\n\nConsider using the Pretty Screenshot (by MeatROme [2006-07-05 17:05]) script to avoid ugly output as well as the HUD and hudgun to clutter that extra nice viewpoint you've chosen for your map. A much more recent Script (by RaZgRiZ [2011-07-26 09:58]) is Q-Screen, so check that out!\nTo shoot from angles where you can't stand on geometry consider switching to gamespeed 10 - that way you don't get the editmode stuff on your screenie ;)\nThe regular screenshot is usually too dark,\nconsider using channel-mixing techniques to enhance the image so it shows up better!\nIn-Game settings can also enhance your screenshots - e.g. fullscreen shaders (bloom, ..), FOV but not gamma!\n\nHave a README\n\nIt's always a good idea to include a readme, usually named something like README_mycontent001.txt;\nplace information in there about creation date, contact information (nice-to-have not must-have) and\nanything pertaining to how to use your work with the engine.\nFor the self-check to work the map filename in the ZIP must be different than the wip_mapname_023 - Work-In-Progress - editing filename was .\nYou should try out your own zip by extracting it into your own game-home-DIR - see the where is my home FAQ on our wiki.\n\nHave a Way-Point file\n\nIt's recommended you provide a .wpt, or whatever waypoints get saved as in your game.\n\nthanks to Quin (2010apr03)\nBloodFrontier, for example, saves them directly into it's map-file, so there's no extra file in such package-ZIPs.\nWay-Point creation - for the record - it's not very difficult. Type /dropwaypoints 1 and run around the map, being sure to avoid complicated moves that the bots cannot handle (rifle/rocket/grenade jumps, etc), in Sauerbraten type /savewaypoints when you are done, or in Blood Frontier simply type /savemap.\n\nBeware of OS caveats\n\nYou should be aware that not everyone out there is running the same OS (operating system) as you are.\nEspecially variations on upper-/lowercase can be a problem here,\neven if your Windows loads the textures fine with the file being image.JPG but the map-CFG loading IMAGE.jpg - it won't work on systems that are aware of case in their filenames (Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, ...) - your safest bet is to always go for lowercase filenames ... and check the extensions (some systems blend them out by default).\nAnother pitfall can be using weird characters in your filenames - even spaces can be quirksome - please avoid them.\n\nrequest for help by MeatROme (2010apr03)\nPeople really ignore the size-increase and cross-platform-nonsensicalness of leaving files like \"Thumbs.db\" or \"._DS_store\", \"__MACOSX\"-directories lying around.\nThere are many explanations out there to help you do this.\nI'd be more than happy to provide per-OS-HowTo's at this point - with due credit to the author -\nso as to improve on the helpfulness of this node.\n\nAll this is to avoid you getting comments like\n\n\"Where do I put this?\" - all packages on quadropolis work the same for their target engine\n\"There's a \"texture missing\" error ...\" - your package is both self-check and backup in one\n\"Why are so many walls not textured?\" - see above\n\"Why can't I hear the music?\" - see above\n\"Please fix your node!\" - either tagged 'packaging error' or referenced in a comment\n\nIf you adhere to the guidelines above you should be safe just pointing newcomers here - or the user guide.\nThe examples are fitted for Sauerbraten content,\nthe other games are sufficiently similar, or will be commented on in appropriate sections.\nBloodFrontier needs no extra .wpt, AssaultCube has packages/maps base directory, stuff like this.\n\nlogin to post comments",

When the war was over and the Identi planet finally conquered, the factory tried to get more commercial, and started producing for other systems and for other wars. To do so, the SastreZ sector was built, it's purpouse was to be the reception for visitors, burocratic employees and other stuff like that.\n\nBut one day one visitor's son brought an ear worm he had as pet secretly into the base, this ear worm escaped this kid's pocket and started reproducing, soon the whole sector was infested with them, every living being was affected by these worms, and acted irrationally.\n\nSoldiers began shooting everyone, burocrats began to sue everyone, soon the whole sector was dead, and the factory closed. Thats when the owner put both Katrez and SastreZ sector to the purpouse of deathmatch.\n\nIt's rumored that the ghosts of the burocrats still roam these hallways, annoying everyone with burocratic crap.\n\nNotes:\nThis was in fact my very first Cube map. I started learning the engine and the editor and this is what came up. I really don't like it as much as I like KatreZ, and I'm going to remake it entirely, removing lots of things and changing the whole structure and also texturing, but I decided to do that in Sauerbraten, and releasing this one for Cube as my final Cube level for the moment. The WDQ count is only 3000 at the bigger areas, so you won't have any real problem.\nWhat I don't like about this level is mainly that has the same textures as KatreZ wich would make it look a little repetitive, but I haven't found a better texture set so this will do for the moment. And also I don't like the structure as much as KatreZ.\nBut anyway, hope you enjoy this one, and also I would like to get as much feedback as you can give me to make the Sauer version.

    "author": "MeatROme | 2006-05-31 16:17",

    "content": "Guide\n\nHOW-TO play sauerbraten\n\n\nThis document is now unmaintained since wiki:Multiplayer Guide has more current information and more contributors to edit it :)\n[2006-08-22] (updated link:2006-12-10)\n\n\nFirst off : Read the documentation,\nit will help you understand the more intricate aspects of the game,\nas well as telling you how to setup your personal configuration.\nIt is in HTML format and located in your\nsauerbraten/docs folder.\n\nI'll try and give you some hints to get you kicked off a little faster though.\n\ncreate a \"autoexec.cfg\" file in your sauerbraten base folder,\nif it doesn't already exist.\nThis is where you will place all your configuration settings.\nYou can modify everything in the game too, but to keep settings you\nshould enter them there. This file is read once upon start of the engine.\nIf you shut down normally (no crash) the engine will write it's current\nconfiguration to a file called \"config.cfg\", sometimes it has been known\nto hold bad data so you might need to delete it if you encounter any\ntroubles (key bindings not working or the like). But this is rarely the case.\nwrite into the autoexec.cfg file (using your favourite text editor)\nname \"myname\"\nteam \"1234\"\nchoose the values to your liking, name is limited to 16 chars,\nteam to 4 chars.\nOther settings you might wish to place into \"autoexec.cfg\" are\nsoundvol, musicvol, sensitivity, sensitivityscale, gamma, fov and maxroll.\nSee the documentation to find out any more commands.\nAlso - users of ATI and NVIDIA cards sometimes are required to have\nspecial commands in there to avoid troubles with their graphics cards.\noqmm, ati_texgen_bug, nvidia_texgen_bug and the likes.\nI'll try and update these as I become aware of more.\n\nfire up sauerbraten\n(using the sauerbraten.bat or sauerbraten_unix shell script)\n\npress ESC(ape) to call up the menu, select \"multiplayer\"\nand then \"update from masterserver\"\nThis will in turn give you a list of currently available servers\nto play on the internet.\nThe list shows number of players, current map and game mode.\nSimply select one to join to it.\n\nwhile playing online you should keep track of what is output to\nthe console, if it scrolled past you can either backtrack\nwith the \"-\" key (numeric keypad) or call up a maximized console\nvia the \"F11\" key. The \"+\" key will reset it to the current line.\n\nprevious to 2006-07-22 release :currently servers in PRIVATE mode are not marked in any way in the\nserver browser, you'll only see a message about being denied access\non your console ... so watch out for that.\nSince the 2006-07-22 release private and locked servermodes get displayed with a \"P\" or \"L\" (respectively),\nthis character is appended to the number of players.\n\nwhen in play you will probably soon see some line like\n\"foo suggests instagib on map curvedm (select map to vote)\"\nThis means that another player has decided it would be more fun\n(for him/her) to play on that map in that mode.\nTo agree with them - and force a map/mode switch on the server -\nsimply go into your menu, multiplayer and use the vote submenus\nto set the same map and mode as in the line you saw in your console.\n\nsome modes are team modes. In case you have joined or voted for a\nmatch in team mode it is suggested you modify your team setting\nso as to end up with two distinct teams on the server.\nBest to do this before the vote is accepted too, so probably you'll\nchat about going to team mode before actually voting for it.\nIn some cases more teams can be considered but generally two should\nbe the number to go for.\nTo change your setting during play simply call up the chat console\nand type any commands with a preceding \"/\".\nSo - like in autoexec.cfg - to change your team just type:\n\"/team red\"\nFor ease of use red & blue team settings are available from the\nmultiplayer menu too.\n\nThere are some mastermodes to consider as well;\nthe first player to join (or next in line if he/she disconnects)\nis considered the MASTER, the current player with this power\nis depicted in green letters on your scoretable (\"TAB\" key).\nIf the MASTER sets mastermode to 1 anything he/she votes for will\nbecome active immediately - MM1 is called VETO.\nMM2 is called LOCKED, this means any new players to join the server\nwill automatically be made SPECTATOR. This is useful especially\nfor team mode matches, where the players would like to keep the\n(hopefully balanced) teams and avoid distraction by people joining\nand disconnecting all the time.\nOnly a MASTER can change SPECTATORS back into active players,\nyou can always make yourself a spectator by typing \"/spectator 1\".\nMM3 is called PRIVATE and will deny anybody from joining the server.\nTo relinquish any power the MASTER can type \"/mastermode 0\" to reset\nthe server to MM0, which is called OPEN.\n\nEnjoy the game and respect your fellow players, if you don't the current\nMASTER might see it fit to BAN you. This BAN will be lifted as soon\nas the server is empty once again.\n\nPassa has written a nice tutorial (with screenshots) that explains some of this too and goes more into depth about setting up your sauerbraten for a Win32 system.\nE.g. screen resolution, shortcut properties and a look at the basic folder where it all begins ...\n\nAnother FAQ, more focused on Cube so some aspects only apply to that, but installation for linux is discussed which remains valid for Cube2 (Sauerbraten) and will probably get you going even if your getting going with Cube3 (Eisenstern) [unreleased as of 2006-06-07].\n\nIn case you haven't you should definitely check the documentation regulary.\nBe sure there isn't a command you've forgotten completely about -\nbut which at your current level of involvement -\nwill help you do what you want in the game.\n\nAnother good call at this point is : Keep Backups!\n\nIf you regularly perform a task, you might think about scripting it.\nBind an easy to remember command to an alias and thus enable yourself to call a set of actions\nat any convenient time.\nAfter all you can always place stuff you seldom need but then dearly always place into your menus.cfg.\n\nWhen using scripts for maps remember that _before_ any map is loaded default_map_settings.cfg is executed.\n\nWhen having trouble with scripting and/or general behaviour of the engine it helps to send config.cfg to it's room and deal with that later, apart from autoexec.cfg the general settings of the game (from defaults.cfg) will be used for the next run of the engine.\n\nIf you are running into problems with your graphics card note precise card specifications, operating system and release date of your currently installed engine.\nplease always ensure for yourself to have installed most adequate driver and that other applications already work as advertised.\nBut if you didn't find anything in the local documentation HTML about some switch to test for lower compatibilities you might find it via the\ncubeforum-search : \"texgen_bug\"\n\nlogin to post comments",

When the war was over and the Identi planet finally conquered, the factory tried to get more commercial, and started producing for other systems and for other wars. To do so, the SastreZ sector was built, it's purpouse was to be the reception for visitors, burocratic employees and other stuff like that.\n\nBut one day one visitor's son brought an ear worm he had as pet secretly into the base, this ear worm escaped this kid's pocket and started reproducing, soon the whole sector was infested with them, every living being was affected by these worms, and acted irrationally.\n\nSoldiers began shooting everyone, burocrats began to sue everyone, soon the whole sector was dead, and the factory closed. Thats when the owner put both Katrez and SastreZ sector to the purpouse of deathmatch.\n\nIt's rumored that the ghosts of the burocrats still roam these hallways, annoying everyone with burocratic crap.\n\nNotes:\nThis was in fact my very first Cube map. I started learning the engine and the editor and this is what came up. I really don't like it as much as I like KatreZ, and I'm going to remake it entirely, removing lots of things and changing the whole structure and also texturing, but I decided to do that in Sauerbraten, and releasing this one for Cube as my final Cube level for the moment. The WDQ count is only 3600 at the bigger areas, so you won't have any real problem.\nWhat I don't like about this level is mainly that has the same textures as KatreZ wich would make it look a little repetitive, but I haven't found a better texture set so this will do for the moment. And also I don't like the structure as much as KatreZ.\nBut anyway, hope you enjoy this one, and also I would like to get as much feedback as you can give me to make the Sauer version. Good luck!\n\nFinal Version:\nHere it is. The final version of SastreZ. You'll probably wonder why didn't I updated the old post of this one, well mainly because no one will even see it since the site doesn't announce it like new posts, and also because it now looks a lot better than the previous beta. I've reduced the amount of ammo in the level since it was just too much, also added a new area. I've worked a lot on the lightning of the level and giving a meaning to those lights (I mean, putting lamps, candles, etc), I think it looks a lot better and I'm pleased with it, and hope you'll be also.\nSuggestions, critics, feedback, everything is apreciated.

Got rid of the two quads (I forgot that I already had a third one). Moved the armour around just a little bit to make it easier, and actually possible to get. The biggest changes came with the doorways which now have a lot more going for them. Last, I modified some of the lighting for the rooms and added trimming in parts of them to again improve the look.

    "title": "Home ~ Skyboxes",
    "author": "sinsky | 2006-07-08 18:25",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Guide\n\nAlthough probably not as fun as level design, making skyboxes can add a lot to the experience of creating a map, as well as the atmosphere and gameplay of a level. Skyboxes can be loaded with the \"loadsky\" command, followed by the path to the files. The \"loadsky socksky/desert\" command for example will load the desert skybox located in the folder packages\\socksky. You can browse to this folder and view the six images that compose the panorama you see in game. This guide will focus on the process of creating a skybox with several software rendering packages.\n\nMany of the Cube and Sauer skyboxes were created with Terragen. You can find a detailed step-by-step tutorial by googling for \"Terragen skybox\" and \"Lloyd M\". In Terragen, as well as in the other packages we're about to use, there are a few basic rendering parameters that need to be set for each of the six images so they can blend seamlessly. In Terragen v0.9 (the version used here), all of the parameters can be accessed from the Rendering settings window. Images need to be square, so first click on Image size and set both height and width to 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc. Click Camera settings and set Zoom / Magnification to 1. Below is the camera orientation, which you can set individually for each image before rendering:\n\nskybox_LF -- pitch = 0, head = 0\nskybox_RT -- pitch = 0, head = 180\nskybox_BK -- pitch = 0, head = 90\nskybox_FT -- pitch = 0, head = 270\nskybox_DN -- pitch = -90, head = 0\nskybox_UP -- pitch = 90, head = 0\n\n\nAll images must be saved in jpeg format, the last two images (filename_up and filename_dn) must be flipped horizontally and vertically. So after rendering you should edit the images in image processing software like Adobe Photoshop, The Gimp, etc. and make the needed changes. You could also add stuff and use a smudge tool or other tools to make additional corrections.\n\nTerragen also allows to make a simple six-frame animation script to turn the camera and render the files automatically as opposed to editing parameters every time you render. Here's an example script (can be saved in a text file and then loaded in Terragen from the Terragen->Execute script menu):\n\nInitAnim \"c:\\folder\\filename\", 1\nCamP 0\nCamH 0\nFRend\n\nCamH 180\nFRend\n\nCamH 90\nFRend\n\nCamH 270\nFRend\n\nCamH 0\nCamP -90\nFRend\n\nCamP 90\nFRend\n\nIf you are not comfortable with editing each image individually, a batch file could be used to convert the images produced by the above script automatically. Windows batch files are text files that have the .bat extension and can be used to execute several commands. You can place the batch file in the folder where the images reside. When you double-click the file (filename.bat), the sequence of commands it contains is started (and hopefully, will end in a few seconds). If you have ImageMagick installed these commands can be, for example:\n\nconvert filename0001.bmp skybox_lf.jpg\nconvert filename0002.bmp skybox_rt.jpg\nconvert filename0003.bmp skybox_bk.jpg\nconvert filename0004.bmp skybox_ft.jpg\nconvert -flip -flop filename0005.bmp skybox_dn.jpg\nconvert -flip -flop filename0006.bmp skybox_up.jpg\n\n\nThis tutorial is not finished. Two more sections are planned, with info on using Blender and POV-Ray.\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Hi! ;-)\n\nFirst of all, sorry if my english sounds bad because I'm a brazilian and I speak and mainly I think in portuguese... 8-P But I understand perfectly the english language...\n\nHere are my suggestions...\n\nLet me say that I downloaded everything from this site.... with the exception of the guides...\n\n1 - Split or Divide the Maps, Mods, Scripts and Guides section, one for the Cube Engine and one for the SauerBraten engine, because many people here could want to download only maps for Cube or only for SauerBraten...\n\n2 - Create a standard file naming system (SFNS)... because I found many *.RAR and other extensions like *.cgz and *.ogz (cube and sauerbraten maps)\n\n3 - About the SNFS mentioned above something like get the *.RAR files, unpack and pack with ZIP and the same goes to the other files\n\n4 - The same SNFS goes to the scripts/guides and mods...\n\n5 - When I downloaded everything one of the boring things that I found was the pages of the files (16 total) with 158 files carrying about 10 each...\n\n6 - I tried creating an account \"Butcher\" to see if there is an option for displaying 50 files or all the files but I didn't find an option... So I need to click 16 times to download all the files......\n\n7 - The use of the thumbnails, well, I don't like this so much but this is a personal issue because this demand waste of the time for loading the pages... (I still have a 56k modem connection)\n\n8 - Put a page like... the last 10 files added to each section or the last files added in the last week or the last month...\n\n9 - This can be useful for people like me for downloading only the last maps added.\n\n10 - Create a template Text for the maps/mods/scripts/guides and this template will inside each *.ZIP file like this\n\nhttp://www.gamers.org/pub/idgames/UPLTEMPL.TXT\n\nBecause if the Cube/SauerBraten engines are good enignes, so I think that the *.cgz and *.ogz files could have the same kind of information like the...\n\n- WAD Files - DOOM, DOOM2, HERETIC, HEXEN, STRIFE and the Rise of the Triad\n- BSP Files - Quake / Quake 2 / Hexen 2 / Heretic 2 / Half-Life / Quake 3\n- MAP Files - Duke Nukem 3D / Shadow Warrior / Blood / Redneck Rampage\n- UNR Files - Unreal Engine / Na Pali / Tournament\n\nAnd one last thing This file is missing: http://www.quadropolis.us/files/castle.zip\n\nPlease take look at the CASTLE located at the 11th page..\n\nThanx for reading this and my best regards!!! 8-D\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Deathmatch | Small (1-4)\nBlurb A small, back area of a starport on some random planet. :D\nScreenshot \nGet original file (33KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThis map took me about 8 or 9 hours to complete, over the course of a week.\nIt is built for about 4-5 players.\n\nIf I can remember correctly, the ent list is:\n5x spawn points\n3x health packs\n2x shotgun shell boxes\n2x rifle clips\n1x bullet boxes\n1x pack of rockets\n1x green armor\n1x health boost\nNo yellow armor or quad damage. No teleports.\n\nIt is based loosely on the Ramsees Hed Docking Port on Cal-Seti from Starwars Darkforces.\nI started playing around with a small wall (the bigger outside area is actually where I started hehe) and trying out some textures. I was originally going to use the tech textures but they were too light and didn't suit my preferences. If you compare it to the actual level, this one has less hallways and not as run-down. It also has more of a darker atmosphere as opposed to the bright blue skies it has.\n\nI didn't really want to venture into the big goliath block textures but still have a big, sci-fi feel.\n\nThe glass that serves as a wall in one area is actually supposed to be a forcefield, but you can't cut or curve glass so I just decided to fill the visible area up with it to keep it from looking funky.\n\nI also clipped above the outer walls. I wished to keep a low-wall feeling however keep the players inside and limit outer level design.\n\nThe only big I can find might be with the sky. It tends to have black spots for split seconds but it isn't major. Might just be me. Otherwise just minor texture blending problems almost every map has. :)\n\nI am thinking about updating this map again possibly. Not sure though.\n\nMap file Xsaii_2.zip (504.56 KB)\nRating\n6\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

I've been out a long time, since I had some personal things to attend, and also I couldn't find the inspiration necessary to make anything I like. But that inspiration is somehow back, and messing around yesterday I fixed this map made by my brother and I think it looks better now, also I've redistributed the entities, fixed player starts and arranged the lights a bit.\nYou can see the previous version here: http://www.quadropolis.us/node/201\n\nWith this I finish my cube mapping career for the moment to work more on Sauerbraten. I'm already porting this same map and SastreZ, so expect news soon ^^\n\nHope you all enjoy this one, and as always any kind of feedback is really apreciated.\n\nUpdate v1.1:\nNew deluxe edition, updated the map with Sauerbraten version's textures to make it look more nice to the eyes.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Deathmatch | Medium (5-8)\nBlurb The newly rebuilt Chronos\nScreenshot \nGet original file (23KB)\nDetailed description\n\nChronos was one of the original arenas used for modern gladiatorial games. An arena that, while not the most brutal, offered a challenge to even the most skilled warrior.\n\nOver the many years of combat in the gladiatorial games, Chronos saw its share of bloodshed. However, not all things are made to last forever. The harsh combat took its toll on the arena and it slowly began falling apart.\nThe end for Chronos came in the year 2187 when the Gladiatorial Fighting Commission declared the arena to be too heavily worn to provide a suitable place for matches. Often times, competitors were being injured or killed by failing pieces of the aging structure. The arena was spared demolition due to the fact that its deterioration was so extensive that no company was willing to take the risk of demolishing the venue.\n\nIn time, Chronos was all but forgotten. Then, in the year 2215, the CEO of SolCorp, Wilhelm Falke, came across the derelict while surveying the area for a new mining operation. The arena was still under ownership by Marmaduke Industries. Wilhelm purchased the arena for a mere 20,000,000 credits, one tenth the cost to originally build it. Repair and restructuring of Chronos was started immediately and was completed in 2118. Thus Chronos Phoenix was born.\n\nAt first, the GFC was unwilling to allow the rebuilt arena to become a part of the list of official fighting venues. Upon hearing this, Wilhelm Falke sent invitations to two of the most highly respected teams in the league, Team Ronin and Team Vengeance. The two teams fought in a televised exhibition match at the same time of the GFC's Blood Tournament finals. When more people tuned in to witness the carnage taking place at Chronos than did the Blood Tournament final, the GFC gave in and admitted Chronos Phoenix to the list of combat arenas.\n\nLong ago, Chronos would give any person who battled there nightmares for a week. Now, they will be lucky to ever sleep again, having fought at Chronos Phoenix.\n\nMap file chronosphoenix.zip (1.95 MB)\nRating\n16\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

You can hang out on a top platform, but even so, protection is minimal, and there is no health on the higher platforms (except a megahealth).\n* Minimal hiding spots. If you want to chat, go use an instant messenger.\n* Quad intentionally requires two rocket jumps (one if you are fairly good at them). This way, when you get quad, you will be weakened. It's a small price to pay. ;)\n* No yellow armor on the map. This allows newly-spawned players to have a fighting chance.\n* Weapons distributed fairly randomly.\n* A fair amount of health. You can stay alive a long time with the health on the map, but it's lower on the map.\n\nIt should work well as a free-for-all; lesser as an instagib map.

That´s just the theme though.\nGameplay is fast and arcade.\n\nVisit our website:\nhttp://action.cubers.net\nfor downloads and information.\n\nJoin us in irc: #actioncube @ quakenet\n\nWe had lots of fun doing this, and we basically were noobs in our fields when we started.\nWe learned a lot, cursed a lot \\o/´ed a lot, sweat a lot, kicked each others asses a lot; and now it´s finally done.\nIt was a great experience and we hope you´ll give it a try and have fun.\n\nYou might ask \"Cube-mod? wtf?! Why not Cube2?\"\n\nWhen we started in July 2004, Sauerbraten was still labelled \"for devs and adventurous mappers only\".\nWhen the first mature release of Sauerbraten was out a year later, we decided to stick with cube rather than forking off an uncomplete, early-stage Sauer-version.\n\nA port of ActionCube to ActionBraten might be considered at some point in the future, when the Cube2-FPS has somewhat reached a final state.\n\nSome brief info:\n\n8 New Weapons:\n\nKnife\nPistol\nAkimbo Pistols (powerup)\nPumpgun\nSubmachine Gun\nAssault Rifle\nSniper Rifle\nTimeable HE Grenades\n\nGamemodes:\n\n7 Multiplayer Gamemodes:\n\nTeam Deathmatch\nTeam Survivor\nCapture the Flag\nDeathmatch\nLast Man Standing\nPistol Frenzy\nLast swiss Standing\n\nBot Deathmatch Singleplayer\n\nWe´re looking forward to your feedback.\n\nMac bins are in the works.\n\n(!)

A picture and thought. It was this picture above. I said to myself. \"Why not just give it a go.\" So for one week I messed around on sauerbraten and finally made half of the map! Then I accidently quit sauerbraten without saving... (Hey, Now dont call me stupid, Anyone could make that mistake.) I kicked up a small temper and... hurt myself while attacking my computer then sat down and started making it again. This time saving after every hour. At last the ultimate masterpiece was complete. A name... Whats orange like this map... Octron! Yes thats it. And so thats the story of cube master and making the map octron. As you probably know, It took a long time so please give it some good comments. Hope you like this map. Yes, I know its got the weirdest design probably ever used in sauerbraten but it has a very interesting effect. Have a battle in this. Pretty good, I say.

But one day the manager of the shoe factory was murdered with a shoe in his throat. The crime was never solved, and the factory closed down.\n\nAfter that the RVSF took over one of the storage facilities, and ever since this become a dangerous place. Recently the CLA has installed themselves in the other facility, unleashing a rough war in the whole zone.\n\nThe manager of the shoe factory was buried with the shoe in his throat and a statue was made in his memory.\n\nNotes:\nFor this map I set a personal goal. To start and finish an ActionCube map before I went on vacations. And I did, I worked in this map for only four days, and I'm really happy with the outcome. The irony is that my vacations were screwed, but that's another subject =P\n\nThe map is a medium sized, for 6-10 players, it has spawns for ffa and for teams. It's set in a realistic theme with three industrial facilities, you can go inside two of them though.\n\nSpecial thanks to makkE that helped me with a little issue =)\nI hope you download it, enjoy it, and if you want drop me a comment about what you think of it. Until next one!\n\nUpdate v1.1:\nAlright, the map has been fully corrected, works perfectly for version 0.91 and also I've updated it with some new mapmodels, made by dcp, and some few arrangements. Hope you enjoy it.\n\nUpdate v1.2:\nWell, I was planning on releasing this like a month ago, and actually I had it finished about that time, lost track of time I guess xD. I've corrected minor bugs and detailed some places, nothing really noticeable. Also fixed the playerstarts that were bugged, and moved arround some obstacles so there's more room for moving around. I was going to make bot waypoints but I really don't understand how to, so I didn't xD.\n\nUpdate v1.3:\nHad this one finished some time ago, got the urge for mapping again so I'm working on fixing my old maps. This update improves both gameplay and graphics. I've expanded doors, corridors and some rooms that were a little stuffed, added some new rooms around also. In some places I've remade the lights, also modified the looks on the white building, and added more detail everywhere. I'm open to comments and hope you all like it =D\n\nMap file Filthy RatTrap v1.3.zip (1.19 MB)\nRating\n16\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

But sadly an evil wizard locked it up for himself, and called it \"My Robe's Personal Bathroom\", for the only purpose of washing his mighty robe.\n\nTime passed and the wizard die drowned by his own magical robe. The place was forgotten and the robe went on to become a musician. In the present the place was found by a wandering fella who donated it for deathmatch.\n\nNotes:\nIt's finally here, this one took me a lot of work, headaches and long mapping nights. The map originally made by my brother for cube, I've modified, then ported it to Sauerbraten and detailed it a lot, changed most of the textures and added mapmodels everywhere. But, I'm releasing this before it's finished, since tomorrow I'll be going on vacations for two weeks to the mountains, and I wont have any kind of internet connection or any civilization at all =P\n\nI wanted to add some more things to this map, but I need a texture artist who is willing to work with me on this one, this includes bump mapping some textures, modifying some others, really dumb jobs that I can't do on my own. But this petition I make for the begining of february, before that I'm not at home and I wont answer any mails.\n\nI'm pretty happy with the outcome of the map, I think it looks great and hope you too, and wait for the next version that will be even better ^_^.\n\nUpdate v2.1:\nWell, here it is, after all this time, I'm releasing the map the way I originally wanted to do but couldn't make it in that moment, I've learned how to use photoshop and modified the textures needed to be done, also removed those clipped lamps as everyone wanted, and as a plus added a lot more of detail everywhere, hope you like it as much as I do, next version will probably be with bump mapping.\nAlso, as a bonus, I'm releasing a new \"deluxe\" version of this map for Cube (v1.1), modified to make it look more like this version.\nLink: http://www.quadropolis.us/node/339\n\nUpdate v2.2:\nAlright, so I wanted to update this one a long time ago, but frankly, I was afraid of bump mapping, really scared of it. Time passed on and I realized it wasn't so hard, and went working on it. The textures were made with CrazyBump (www.crazybump.com), excellent and simple program, and then most of them were retouched with Photoshop. Also I've added small fixes around, some neat details and fixed all the lightning so it would look better.

Second, there are floating boxes and a floating platform - they are made for the player to train their shooting skills from air-to-ground and ground-to-air, meaning that you get better all the time. The basic defensive idea is more like map complex, where you have part of the map for standing at the top and part for higing and the safest place being under the actual platform.\n\nThank you!

    "content": "AssaultCube | Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Other Mod | News\n\nMaps that used to be listed as \"Multiplayer\" are now listed as \"Deathmatch\". This is a minor but overdue change which provides useful detail to the map-type list. I've added \"Capture\" and \"CTF\" types... I mulled it over in my mind, and every other solution involved adding a laundry-list of taxonomy names (which would all appear at the top of every node they applied to)... so instead, I focussed on compatibility, as I did at the beginning.\n\nIf you've uploaded any maps as \"multiplayer\" for which the designation \"CTF\" or \"Capture\" would be more appropriate than their new designation \"Deathmatch\", it would be appreciated if you'd go and change that (where CTF is ActionCube's CTF mode, and Capture is Sauer's Dom-style Capture mode).\n\nedit: also, because of Digital Spaghetti's nice \"Cheatsheet\", I've added a (very small) space for uploading data as part of stories and guides.\n\nedit2: I've set up a new, better Search page!\n\nedit3: Attention ActionCube mappers: If your AC map works in all AC multiplayer modes, please tag it as both Deathmatch and CTF.\n\nread more for further discussion of these decisions.\n\nReasons for the decision\n\nMost capture maps are not DM maps, and vice versa, but most instagib maps are just as good as TDM maps. I would've liked to have included one taxonomy term for each gametype if Drupal would allow that to be done gracefully - but it doesn't. The only issue for me was Arena modes since, while technically they are compatible with DM maps, their layout is fundamentally different. Still, given the abysmal unpopularity of Arena, I've left that out of the list.\n\nI changed the name of \"Multiplayer\" to \"Deathmatch\" because the capture and TDM modes are also multiplayer modes.\n\nUploading files for Guides\n\nThe guides section is kinda pointless - a Wiki does guidework better, and using the Wiki is OnceAndOnlyOnce, which is good policy with everything, not just code. Maybe one day we'll take down the Guides section.\n\nBut for now, it should be useful... and useful guides often require pictures and files, so every user is getting 2 megs of arbitrary data storage for their guides - you can attach as many files as you like to the guides. If it becomes a problem, we'll nuke it. If you need more space, just ask.\n\nlogin to post comments",

I had been paying attention to the comments on the previous maps, people wanted a larger room, breaking the monotone corridors, i can do that, a lot of elements are repeated all along the map, but with different lighting you still can achieve an effect of them being different.\n\nLight reflecting of bright surfaces also adds to the atmosphere, a good example and inspiration to do so is the official map \"Metl2\". It really makes a difference if you pay attention to those details. Off course it also helps if you have some education and experience with illustrating, 3d modelling and design in general. Also, do some homework, do a bit of study in gothic churches and cathedrals by looking a some pictures (google is your friend) if you want a medivial look on your maps for example, it really adds to atmosphere if you have those tiny details covered as well.\n\nAs for using the old textures, ahem.. that has a bit to do with the machine i am working on, its a almost 5 year old Athlon 1.8 with a gig of memory and a now outdated Gforce 3 Titanium 200 card with just 64mb. I am still thinking about replacing the computer, but then i have a holiday comming up (three weeks in Japan \\O/) so it won't be until well after that holiday that i am going to replace my hardware.\n\nYes that's right, i am making this on a old \"steam powerd\" computer. So i actually have to keep things like framerate in mind, i was not planning to let it drop under 35 frames per seccond, so map making for me is a constant process of tweaking, normalising the map, tweaking again, and so on. It indeed takes time.\n\nMore later :)\n\nMap file DM_BS1.zip (1.09 MB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

We have since added a captcha-authorization for new users to deter spammers. Hopefully this will be enough or we'll have to make the captcha more complex. At any rate, new-user-registration is back.\n\nUnfortunately, we discovered a minor bug in the aftermath: node moderation votes are not undoable. So, moderators, make damn sure you have made up your mind before you hit +1 or -1 on a post. My own use of this like a drunken sailor is why we have a torrent of maps on the front page. Node moderation might be returning to it's hiatus if a solution can't be found.\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "dbox | 2007-04-18 15:47",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Windows\nBlurb Play sauerbraten console-style with your game controller of choice...\nScreenshot \nGet original file (34KB)\nDetailed description\n\nJust for kicks I thought I would see if I could set up game controller support for Sauerbraten. I know most serious PC gamers would never dream of giving up the mouse. Personally, I sometimes get tired of being hunched over the computer and find it relaxing to sit back on the couch and play console-style. So if you've got a pc game controller with at least one stick (preferably analog) on it you might give this a shot.\n\nUPDATE: 04/23/2007 - Changed the joystick configuration menus to use some of sauer's new gui features (e.g. sliders, checkboxes, etc.). This makes the configuration screen a little more intuitive and reduced the number of sub-menus I needed.\n\n\n\nSetup\nThe following steps will install the game controller support. The files are installed along side the existing sauerbraten files and will not affect the ability to play the unmodified original game.\n\nSTEP 1: Backup the data/keymap.cfg file if you want to keep the original\n(the changes are additive and will not affect the original game)\nSTEP 2: Extract this archive into your Sauerbraten directory.\nSTEP 3: Execute the sauerjoy.bat file.\nSTEP 4: Configure your controller by typing \"/joymenu\" in-game (without quotes)\n\n\n\nMenu Configuration\nUsers can now configure game controllers using the intuitive menu-driven interface. Simply type /joymenu in-game to see the following menu:\n\nShow Menu\n\nFrom this menu you can configure all of the joystick settings. I recommend that you first set show events to yes before setting the other properties. This will cause the joystick events to be displayed in the console as buttons are pressed or axes are moved. This should help when deciding which button, pad or axis to use with each setting or action.\n\nFor any who might have been familiar with previous versions of this mod, Sauerbraten's new 3d menus have allowed me to implement some new features. There is a now a new setting, \"emulate mouse\", which will map a joystick button to mouse clicks. This is useful for using the game controller to select menu options, so you don't have to keep switching between mouse and game controller while you're playing.\n\n\n\nHow it works:\nThis section is here for those who might be interested in doing custom scripting, or interested in how the code works. If you aren't interested in this, you might just want to skip down to the Disclaimer section.\nBasically, I took the approach that I would intercept joystick events and translate them into sauerbraten keypress events. This allows joystick events to be \"bound\" to actions like you would any other keyboard or mouse event.\n\nConfig File Settings\nThe following new variables have been defined to configure the joystick. Once set, they will be automatically placed in the autoexec.cfg. The joystick can be completely configured using the dynamic menus.\n\njoyfovxaxis / joyfovyaxis\nThis setting specifies which stick should control the field of view (what the mouse does for you now). Each stick has a horizontal and a vertical axis. Each axis is numbered starting with 1. So, for example, on my controller, which is very similar to the one pictured above, if I wanted the use the left stick the settings would be:\n\njoyfovxaxis 1\njoyfovyaxis 2\n\nor\n\njoyfovxaxis 2\njoyfovyaxis 1\n\ndepending on how your controller numbers the axes.\n\nIf you wanted to use the right one (recommended) the settings would be:\n\njoyfovxaxis 3\njoyfovyaxis 4\n\nor\n\njoyfovxaxis 3\njoyfovyaxis 4\n\n\njoyfovinvert\nSpecifies how the stick controls your field of view. If set to 0 you will look in the direction you press on the stick. If set to 1 (inverted) the control works like a flight simulator: pull back on the stick to nose up, push forward to nose down. This is the default.\n\njoyaxisminmove\nThis property sets up the minimum amount of movement that is required to trigger an event when binding axis movements to actions. The range for this setting is 1-30. If set to 1 you basically just have to breath hard on the stick and it will trigger the event. If set to 30 you'll have to push it practically to the edge. The default is 8.\n\njoysensitivity\nThis is the property you'll probably end up tweaking the most. On certain maps where you're getting really low fps you might need to bump this up a bit. The range for this setting is 1-10 where 1 is the least sensitive and 10 is the most. Remember, these values can be set from within the game. Just type /joysensitivity n at the console to bump the sensitivity up or down, or better yet, create an alias and map this to a couple of your joystick buttons. (See the response below titled \"Joystick Sensitivity Script\" for an example of how to do this.)\n\njoyshowevents\nThis property is meant to be used when configuring your game controller. When joyshowevents is set to 1, all joystick events will be displayed in the console. This will help you determine which button to use when binding actions to the joystick, as well as which axis to use for movement and field of view control.\n\nFor example, if you want to use a certain button to fire your gun, press that button and you will see something like this displayed in the console:\n\nJOYBUTTON7: DOWN\nJOYBUTTON7: UP\n\nYou can then bind that button from within the game by typing:\n\n/bind JOYBUTTON7 [attack]\n\n(Binding joystick events is discussed further in the next section.)\n\nThis is also useful for configuring the field of view axis. In this case you just move the axis to the left and right and then up and down. This will display which axes are being moved which you can use to set the joyfovxaxis and joyfovyaxis values.\n\nBinding Joystick Events\nThere are currently three types of joystick events you can bind to actions:\n\nBinding Buttons\nI've left space for up to 20 joystick buttons that can be bound to the action of your choice. For example, I wanted to map \"attack/shoot\" to my right trigger finger button, and \"jump\" to the trigger finger on the left. On my controller the right trigger button is button 8 and the left trigger button is button 7, so I added the following lines to my autoexec.cfg file:\n\nbind \"JOYBUTTON8\" [attack]\nbind \"JOYBUTTON7\" [jump]\n\n\nBinding Stick Movements\nI've left space for up to 5 sticks (10 total axes) that can be bound to actions. I wanted to use the left stick to control my movement: push forward on the stick to move forward, back to move backward, right and left to strafe. So, I added the following lines:\n\nbind \"JOYAXIS1MIN\" [left]\nbind \"JOYAXIS1MAX\" [right]\nbind \"JOYAXIS2MIN\" [forward]\nbind \"JOYAXIS2MAX\" [backward]\n\n\nBinding Pad Movements\nSome controllers, like the one in the picture above, have those little up/down/left/right \"pad\" or \"hat\" controls. In the picture above I have up mapped to zoom-in and down mapped to zoom-out. The binding for that would look like this:\n\nbind \"JOYHAT1NORTH\" [fov 15; crosshairsize 50]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SOUTH\" [fov 110; crosshairsize 22]\n\nYou could also use that pad for controlling your movement. That would look like this:\n\nbind \"JOYHAT1NORTH\" [forward]\nbind \"JOYHAT1NE\" [forward; right]\nbind \"JOYHAT1EAST\" [right]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SE\" [backward; right]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SOUTH\" [backward]\nbind \"JOYHAT1SW\" [backward; left]\nbind \"JOYHAT1WEST\" [left]\nbind \"JOYHAT1NW\" [forward; left]\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nThis is built from the 2007-04-13 spring edition of Sauerbraten.\nThis works for all(2) of my controllers. I do not know if it will work for you. (Please try it out and let me know.)\nIf your game controller does not have at least one stick, this will not work.\nThis supports only one game controller. If you have more than one connected, I'm just going to take the first one I find.\nIf no game controller is recognized, or the game controller cannot be initialized for whatever reason there will be no notification, sauerbraten will just load as normal.\nI have not tried this on linux yet.\nNote to Cube Players: I have discontinued including updates for the Cube code and executables. You can still get it here. If there was enough interest in the Cube/ActionCube community, I would consider continuing Cube support.\n\nLet me know what you think. I would appreciate any and all feedback.\n\n- dbox\n\nMod file sauerjoy.zip (264.16 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Deathmatch | Small (1-4)\nBlurb Fast paced dm map.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (214KB)\nDetailed description\n\nApril, 29th 2007\n----------------\n\nThis is the newest release of my first map odejoy. I updated it for the spring release.\nI added autograss that was avaible in the newest release. Also I fixed the playerstarts, you\nno longer face any walls when you spawn. I also fixed a bunch of other random problems. I seperated\nthe capture feature from the original odejoy map because I needed to erase things to insert the bases\ncorrectly. It did not seem logical to have a quad and a base side by side. I also added an odejoyb;\nrocknroll suggested putting a ledge instead of the jumppad to get the quad, but I like it the other\nway. So I wanted to give everyone the best of both worlds. This map has evolved alot since it's\noriginal creation in 2002. I really hope this make can eventually meet the standards of a future\nrelease. I am still working on other maps, so this is not my only chance. But the layout in this\nmap is sensational, to me. Enjoy!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install the map and get it to run on Sauerbraten(Cube 2), you must first extract\nodejoy.ogz,odejoy.cfg,odejoy_c.ogz,odejoy_c.cfg,odejoyb.ogz and odejoyb.cfg into the\nSauerbraten/packages/base folder. Once you have these files in the base directory, just type\n/map odejoy.\n\nMap Summary\n-----------\n\nThis map is a medium size multyplayer map which was originally created in Cube, but later\ntransfered into Sauerbraten. This is my very first map for Sauerbraten, and I plan on making many\nmore. This map works best with numbers between 2 and 7. Higher numbers then that, the map tends to\nget crowded, but still is a tun of fun. The map is fast paced, and packed with strategical possibilities.\n\nMap file odejoy.zip (421.88 KB)\nRating\n14\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I've been playing around with the engine, learning to use the editing system for some months now so I feel like it's a pretty good map.\n\nThis map is a small walled village with 4 buildings, a tower, and a sewar system. The buildings have limited interiors, so that they are not too complex for deathmatch, but more than just scenery. I plan on relreasing this map with more varied textures after the contest, and also replacing the pickups. I'm not very good with the pick-ups so any sugestions here would be much appreciated. I'm not sure if I put too much amo or too little. I tried to use almost every texture available, while still keeping a clear theme for the map. I hope you enjoy this map.\n\nMap file Contest1_seclusion.zip (551.15 KB)\nRating\n16\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

The design is fairly straightforward with players spawning around the outside of the map with the intention of most of the fighting taking place in the middle. Camping the spawn points is rather difficult due to the fact that they are almost all out of sight of one another and a player can quickly sneak in behind anyone camping the outer hallways.

I guess I cannot keep improving this map.\n\nOriginal version 1 can still be downloaded here:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?63bidwxdbrw\n\nStory:\nFor some odd reason, time stands still in this usually sleepy cove as disaster encroaches.

I don't really know specifically which textures my map uses, so I used the brute force method.\n\nMaking such an organic shaped terrain was a nightmare. The engine would flip out and \"tear\" some of the more extreme geometries at odd times. I had to repair theses glitches by hand, which was difficult/impossible. You can see some of the scars from this in areas. The heightmap doesn't work very well on established terrain, so I usually couldn't fix these areas with the smoothing. The inside of the lava-chamber took a long time because every square edge had to be rounded by hand.\n\nMy idea for this map was to use vertical water for a game-play element. So, tsunami was what I came up with. That naturally happens on a beach, so I added a volcano, which also gives a lot of game-play possibilities and cool areas. I just wish I could have lava, but I did my best to suggest it using particles, water, and lighting. Maybe its possible with water fog color and different water texture, but I didn't want to screw up my tsunami with orange color.\n\n**I made quite a few changes to help playability. I would love feedback on how I can make it better, especially item placement.\nUPDATE v1.1\nFlatten beach\nMove boat\nEnlarged interior\nFixed terrain glitches\nAdded clips over some rougher terrain\nEnlarge cave openings\n\nVersion 1.2\nMore clip to smooth things out\nEnlarged some indoor areas\nFix more terrain glitches\n\nMap file tsunami_cove_1_2.zip (4.51 MB)\nRating\n34\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

A few people have seen the progress of this map and the results are in. I have spent a good amount of time working on this map and I must say I think it might just be my best on so far. The layout is fairly complex but quite manageable. There are multiple levels and areas of the map, each with its own unique style. The map is quite large... possibly bigger than paradigm and easily bigger than redemption, but it is still small enough for as little as 4-6 players.\nHope everyone enjoys this map :)\n\nNOTE: Might have extra OS X files in it just ignore them.\n\nUpdate(1):\nRedid the item layout and worked on the clipping to make parts of the map work a little better.\n\nUpdate(2):\nReworked quite a bit of the geometry to make some of the narrower parts a bit more accessible. Lighting has been changed slightly as well in some parts to make them a little brighter.\n\nUpdate(3):\nClipping worked on and bases moved around a bit. A few minor texture fixes.\n\nUpdate(4):\nThis is probably the last update.

I must say I am overly pleased with the simplicity I tried to keep when making this map. Its size is a good bit smaller than others I have done and I feel this will work out greatly in FFA. Capture support will probably be added by the next update. One advantage I see this map has is that both people who like fighting in tight corridors and people who enjoy large open spaces will both be at home in here.\n\nUpdate (1):\nAdded support for Capture, although this map isn't really designed with capture as its main purpose. Aside from that, some of the entities have been moved around. The elevator on the ground level now includes a jump pad to make the flow a bit better.\n\nUpdate (2):\nSuggested changes for clipping done. A few items have been moved slightly although the placement might still have changes to it in later updates. A few minor texturing fixes.\n\nUpdate (3):\nA few fixes to textures and geometry.\n\nUpdate (4):\nSmall texture and clipping fixes. Big change is in the central area. There is now a trench running along the bottom and under a few parts of the map. Inside it are some pickups as well as a new spawn. I might add or move one of the bases to that location as it provides a nice strategic location.\n\nUpdate (5):\nFixed the elevator to match the other jump pad locations as well as brightened up the trench.

It was designed to look \"pretty\". As such, I didn't add any weapons or ammo, no health or pickups.\n\nThink of it as a demo map to see what the engine can do and how well (or poorly) your system can run it.\n\nI added some custom sounds for wind and water effects, nothing fancy, and a custom song I wrote for the map that plays in a loop.\n\nLoad it up, wander around, and enjoy.\n\nIf you get stuck on any stairs or a non-flat surface, press E twice and you will bounce out of it. It looks like the engine doesn't handle some weird angles well and the player gets stuck.\n\n---------------\n\nUnzip all the files in this zip file in your Sauerbraten/packages/ folder with directory structure.\n\nIt will unzip the main map files in packages/base and the sound files in packages/sounds/fanatic/\n\n---------------\n\nFix the blocking on curvey chains before running the game, and read more below for details on the map itself.\n\nModify your local file for the curve chain models to make them non-blocking:\n\n[Sauerbraten install]\\packages\\models\\tentus\\chains\\md2.cfg\n\n...from:\n\nmdlspec 100\n\n...to:\n\nmdlspec 100\nmdlcollide 0\n\nThat will make the curve chain non-blocking.

Typically, maps feature a series of creative obstacles that test the player’s dexterity, skill, and thought process. Surviving obstacles sometimes requires problem solving; others involve precise aim combined with quickness and direction. Obstacles range in difficulty, as do the Bunny Track maps themselves. \"\n\nNOTE: A few things don't apply to my Bunny Track, as the Cube 2 engine doesn't support certain features that UT does (EX: dodging).\n\nThis map is just a CONCEPT, so don't expect any fancy lighting, texturing, or extremely detailed geometry.\n\nYou know when you have \"capped\" (Means captured, or Completed) this BT when you capture the base at the end.\n\nThis map IS possible, I have personally capped it.\n\nOh, and if you play BT on UT 99, then please let me know, I would like to join up :D\n\nMap file Desktop.zip (800.6 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This could be a fun Capture level but i'm not sure yet (it was a CTF map on TS2).\nTell me what you think and I may make it into a Capture map as well. Thanks all.\n\nUpdate: Fixed the lighting at bit. Added a few more lights. Made it a bit darker over all.\n\nUpdate2: Sorry guys for updating twice in one day, but after playing around i found some player spawns were looking a the wall. So i fixed them.

It has recommended settings and bindings for competitive matches.\n\nMultiple keys setups (edit OPTIONS at start of config):\n* RDFG (on by default) - to make weapon switching faster and less disruptive to moving around (there is a tutorial at the end which explains this). I've been using bindings like these since 2001 for Quake and UT.\n* WASD (off by default) - due to popular demand, but I recommend you try RDFG for a while.\n* Extra mouse buttons (off by default) - lets you use more keys for weapon switching (and therefore more pwnage).\n* Simple mode (off by default) - removes some keys so you're not overwhelmed with new keys and features.\n* Dvorak (off by default) - for people using the dvorak keyboard layout\n\nFeatures:\n* Keys help (press F1)\n* Easily adjustable options and bindings\n* 1337-pwn3r3r keys - switch to the right weapon instantly while moving in any direction.

By Hirato Kirata\nScreenshot \nGet original file (14KB)\nDetailed description\n\nWhile I was scavenging through some of nexuiz' files, I happened to run across a song that just made me want to build a space floater.\nBasing it heavily on the Evilspace map from there, the map is littered with powerups, jumppads and strangely enough, suitable textures (I'm surprised they were there myself).\nThe skybox and the background music (the one that made me want to build it in the first place) wasn't created or composed by me, I wrote small readmes saying exactly where I found them, and their license. To accommodate the illusion of the modern space farer, there's even a nearby sun to bask the station in some of its glory.\nBuildtime; 4 days, including the time I showered, slept, went to school, or just showing off and getting some constructive criticism.\n\nnote, the website, being hosted on my own computer isn't always up. I need to sleep. The bandwidth is also limited (384 KBit/s upload is). If the site is down, do go to hirato.servegame.org instead. (there's much more bandwidth and uptime, but it may be outdated). While I suspect the map will be uploaded to the quadropolis servers, there's probably nothing to worry about.\n\nUpdate 1; possibly long awaited,\n\nA few texture inconsistencies were corrected\nthe jumppads are more effective, there are two more arches on the top platform\nover 500 more lights were placed, despite most of them having hardly any effect on the map at all\nall the beams/ arches have lights on their side too look more high tech, though I'm not sure that was a good move so to speak\n\nUpdate 2\nThere were only cosmetic changes, by default the lights will flicker, I provided an alternative config in which is doesn't.\nThe lights on the beams/railings are now coloured yellow to match the light entities\nThe arches at the top are now slightly slanted\nThe zip's structure was also checked, in case anyone wants to complain again =-p\n\nAll that's left to do now is to minimise the entries in the config, ask the devs to add some Newtonian physics so a part of one's movement speed gets added to the projectiles (having the grenades explode in your face when you jump across in this map isn't pleasant), and mark this as finished\n\nLICENSE\n==============\nThe music was composed by 70mm13, and distributed under the GNU GPL\n\nnot that there's anything to worry about, but my stuff are also under the GNU GPL ;)\n\nURL http://202.72.164.103/sauerbraten/\nRating\n80\npoints\n (16 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Woop Clan member Drakas was kind enough to answer a few questions regarding this fantastic event, read on for more.\n\nCan you tell me why/how woop holds the frag fest?\n\nWhy - for fun, of course. How - we gather and play. We like to spark more interest in both the Sauerbraten and AssaultCube communities, most of the games done by other groups are region and clan-specific.\n\nWe want to make sure that everyone gets an equal share of fun, not just the Europeans, recruiting some more players into communities is an added bonus.\n\nWhat, if any, measures have been taken to make sure this fest goes more smoothly?\n\nWell, some people will be given passwords, any cheaters/crackers will get iptables-banned at the server level. All fests are demo recorded, and we will be trying to get 2 or 3 servers for the event, as the last fest had almost 20 people per server, we hope to get that down to around 12 for smoother and more fun gameplay.\n\nWe expect it to be alot of fun mainly, and fairly issue-free.\n\nWhat can others do to help Woop make this the best frag fest it can be?\n\nOne thing that people can do is turn up in the Woop channel and participate in the discussion on the Woop website. Needless to say, simply turning up to the event is the best thing people can do. Also, other clans are more than welcome to join in.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like people to know?\n\nI think that the christmas-fest will be more of a clan based competition, we also aim to help create other clans/communities, not just expand ours.\n\nA competitive environment is always good and we encourage that.\n\nYou can visit the Woop Clan website at http://woop.us/ and participate in their discussion at http://woop.us/talk, or join them on IRC in #woop-clan on GameSurge. For more information on the event, or to see videos of the past event, visit http://woop.us/fest. Any questions may be directed at any of the previous resources, or sent directly to Drakas, who's kindly organizing this event.\n\nlogin to post comments",

Points are given\n- for a kill\n- for a suicide of the enemy (lava, etc)\n- for a 2 fouls of the enemy\n-> fouls are:\n-> shoot at the net\n-> serve from line\n-> shoot more than one time on one turn\n-> use the pistol/other weapons\n-> refill by time\n-> jump over the net by time\n-> jump before the 5th shot\n7. Refill at the beginning and after each round. A round ends if someone has got a point.\nNOTICE: If someone makes a foul, the game continue without a refill. After 2 fouls in ine round of a player a point is given and the next round begins!\n8. Change the sites after 2 rounds.\n9. When the players run out of ammo, no one get a point and the round ends.\n10. Special mode: Turn the big green field into lava. (coop-edit-mode required)\n\nThe game mode you can use is ffa.\n\n-----------------------------------\n-- install and play instructions\n-----------------------------------\n\nPut the file tennis.ogz into \\packages\\base of your Sauerbraten folder. You can switch to it ingame by typing /map tennis .\nThis map is only senseful in Multiplayer. Be sure, that everyone has it. To share it with the people on a server, do that:\n1. Take master (/setmaster 1) or coop with the master, if there is already one.\n2. Change/make the master change the map to this one (/map tennis), in coop-edit mode. This mode is required!\n3. Upload the map (/sendmap) and let the others first get the map (/getmap) and afterwards save the map (make them type /savemap tennis)\n4. Restart the map (/map tennis), advised game mode is ffa. Now you and the others can take the ammo, that's cause these steps are important.\n5. Now you can play! :)\n\n-----------------------------------\n-- additional information\n-----------------------------------\n\nYou can get help in the Thread in the The-Conquerors forum. Use the link above. Or you can write an e-mail to hero[at]the-conquerors[dot]net.\n\nHave fun with this idea! :)\nHero\n\nMap file tennis.zip (17.89 KB)\nURL http://the-conquerors.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2589#2589\nRating\n44\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I've been working with several others before (Golden Source (internal name of the modified Quake Engine used for the first game of the Half-Life Series), Unreal Engine, Serious Engine, etc.), so I'm not all new to mapping. But I have to say that Sauerbraten offers the most straight-forward tools I've ever worked with.\n\nMap file StD_Sauerena.zip (1.86 MB)\nRating\n30\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

You wake up in a cell, with little, to no idea of where you are, or what you're doing there. A quick glance at your surroundings, you spot a nearby vent that possibly leads to your freedom. You enter it, and wonder as to why its so close to the ground, and why you, a prisoner still has a weapon. Eventually chaos ensues at your behest.\n\nThe map is a deep-space style map, using several modified textures, many well written triggers (opinions may vary), and what is currently \"totally-sweet\" in CVS like exploding barrels and elevators.\n\nThe zip itself contains a few sounds that're essential to the ambience. A song (M-Theory 1, by AdmiralConquistador, licensed under the CC license) that suits the theme quite well, a custom skybox (once again, not made by me), a modified lava texture, the map itself, and what is currently one of but many tests I'll have to create to extend the level's gameplay.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Work in Progress | Deathmatch | Small (1-4)\nBlurb A second gravity-shifting map!\nScreenshot \nGet original file (51KB)\nDetailed description\n\nUPDATE: I decided to touch up a few details in the map. Mainly, I removed some \"double teleport\" bugs, deleted teleports that did nothing, and made ammo much easier to find. I also placed bases, two in each dimension, just to see how capture would work out. Also added a couple of details to prevent some “accidental” teleports.\n\nOverall, I think the update is good. However, due to the change in glass type in the new version of Sauerbraten, the map loses a bit of its looks, but there is not much I can do about that :(\n\nLast note: I do not want to hear anyone say “I think it will not work” until they have actually playtested the map. Considering the concept, I think the map is surprisingly playable if one learns their way around it.\nOriginal description follows.\n\nThis is my second gravity-shifting map, and this one aims to be actually playable. Be sure to check out my first, Dimensions (http://www.quadropolis.us/node/848). Several people have asked to see the concept applied to a \"real map\", and I think this is as practical as it will get.\nThe idea is this: walk into an arrow, and the gravity will switch to the wall at which it is pointing (actually, you will be taken into another dimension with the gravity in that direction, so it is not true multi-gravity). In an attempt to make the concept playable, I have made the map a small cube, a sort of \"gravity lab\". All the platforms are semi transparent so that it is easier to find other players to shoot at (this was a problem in \"Dimensions\"). I have also tried as well as I could to place platforms in such a way that the map is playable from all sides.\nWhen you play the map, please PLAYTEST it! Do not just suppose that it is unplayable. Get a feel for the map (this may take a bit of time), then play with a friend so that I can find out if the map is at least somewhat practical.\nThis will be my last gravity map, but if people show enough interest in either gravlab or dimensions, I may update them to make them more attractive.\nI hope you like my map. I spent a lot of time making it, and some details were a real hassle. I include a skybox with the map that I specifically made for gravlab (unfortunately, terragen couldn’t be used for this purpose), so make sure that it works. The map looks completely different without its skybox.\nHopefully, the map is at least worth a look. Keep in mind that making it was not as easy as it would seem.\n\nMap file gravlab.zip (662.38 KB)\nRating\n22\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Its devided into 4 levels, which consist of one underground corridor, the ground level, the top floor and a bridge above the whole arena. This shoud encourage for \"surprise attacks\" such as enemys jumping down on you which you will not see looking up etc.\n\nThis map is purely experimental and I will surely work on it a little, since it's my first map im sure texturing isn't all too good yet, but I tried.\n\nMy main goal was to make it a fun map with good gameplay (which I hope i have achieved since all corridors, stairways, etc should enable enough room for jumping / dodging)\n\nHence I'd encourage DMs and Instagibs on this map\n\nAdvice, critisism and ratings are very welcome\n\nK1P57A - It's Fragtastic!\n\nEDIT 1: clip/noclip added, some changes in texturing, .cfg edited ;), some lighting edited\n\nMap file kipsta.zip (1.45 MB)\nRating\n120\npoints\n (15 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

The passage has a little ledge for running around, and the lava chamber has a health boost. Ammo and armor is placed in each quarter of the map.\n\nSo far, it's a little skimpy on details. The only detailed things are the gargoyles--please take a look at them, it took a long time to do them (and I still don't think they're quite right!).\n\nAs far as gameplay, it's rather simple--perhaps too simple. I tried to push away from the habit of making just one floor, but it only resulted in the ledge running around the outside passage. It should work better in insta than any other mode.\n\nYou might notice a somewhat rumbling sound in the background every so often, this is intended to be a constrained demon somewhere, but the sound didn't quite work right. (This is the result of that \"delayed sound play\" thread on the forum--thanks again to everyone who helped me!) It doesn't mesh with all the music too well, either, so feel free to disable it or set it to play only some music that fits.\nThe whispering around the pickups, however, work perfectly.\n\nI welcome (and encourage) all comments; this is but my second \"real\" map and the only one suitable for actual play.\n\nOh, and this is my entry for the running contest...

Everyone has gone, but the base was left open and unattended.\n\nYour job is to wander around and figure out what happened, and discover any mysteries left behind... (cue evil music here)\n\nAnyway, hopefully there's enough to look at and enjoy. Right now it's just another wandering nomonsters type of map.

You even saved our secret base from an enemy invasion! NOTE: This is a multiple-mission-map-pack that is NOT included in the official Sauerbraten release. If you haven't played this epic epidode yet, you should download it here: http://www.quadropolis.us/node/311\n\nOn Adam Parker Day 2, we sent you into enemy territory to recover any information you could about a secret stone called \"SYON\". Again, you proved your worth to us as you infiltrated their base and brought back to us the numbers that were carved into the SYON stone for decoding. NOTE: This map is included in Saurbraten, and is called \"The Ancient Stone\".\n\n(extra special note: the soundtrack for this map is the most daring piece of MIDI music I've made to date. It contains several unique pieces of music within the same soundtrack and it's 21 minutes long!!)\n\nAND NOW - - - -\n\nADAM PARKER - DAY THREE:\n------------------------\nGreat job on finding SYON, Adam!!\nWe knew we could count on you to finish the mission!\n\nWe've had our coding deparment working on those numbers you retrieved from SYON yesterday.\nThey've been here all night long, and have succesfully unscrambled the codes.\n\nIt appears that some of the numbers from SYON are exact directions to the secret hide-out of \"QUEEN MARVARIA\" - one of the top Mutainian officers!!! Her hide-out appears to be located in the 7th sector, West of Station Zero. It's gonna be a hard push on our power systems, but we CAN beam you out there!\n\nAs you know, Adam - Queen Marvaria has been a thorn in our side for centuries!\nShe gains her power from the leaves of the \"NIGHT-BLOOMING IXIA PLANT\" - an extremely rare plant that the queen has possesed for over a thousand years.\n\nOur Sattellite intelligence entercepted an encryted message that the queen will be away from her hide-out for the next 48 hours. This is our perfect chance to strike, since her forces will be weakend without her presence!\n\nWhat we hope is that you can find her IXIA Plant, and bring it back to headquarters.\nLegend has it that without her plant, the Queen should wither and perish.\n\nThe plant will surely be well guarded, Adam - you'll need to stay on your toes if you plan on coming home alive! Her soldiers won't let you just walk in and take away their be-loved Queen's power!\n\nBe sure to keep your eyes peeled for hidden areas as well -- It's been rumored that the Queen's hide-out is WELL STOCKED with plenty of extra ammo in case of an invasion!\n\nWe have also heard of a well-stocked SHRINE dedicated to Queen Marvaria where her followers pray to her daily. It might be wise to try and find this shrine and take what you can! You can bet that it WON'T be easy to find, so take your time and really poke around!\n\nLastly, we're aware of Queen Marvaria's use of a special \"happy gas\" to keep her troops brainwashed. We've equipped you with a gas mask so this gas will not affect you.\n\nWe're counting on you Adam - You MUST NOT FAIL!! Bring us back the NIGHT-BLOOMING IXIA PLANT!\n\nMAP INFO:\n---------\nBuild Time: MONTHS and MONTHS and MONTHS (WHEW!!!)...\nMain Build Version: Spring '07 Release (finished the map with the Summer '07 Release, and just a TOUCH of the \"Assasin\" Release: one set of exoploding barrels...)\n\nSecret Areas: 5\n(these \"secret\" areas contain small wooden crates that have \"SECRET\" printed on them,\nso you'll know when you find them! Count them up to make sure you find all five!)\n\nHidden Areas: 2\n(2 official hidden areas which have \"HIDDEN AREA\" signs)\n\nNew Textures from Six Dog Studios: 3\n1. computer keyboard \"top\"\n2. computer keyboard \"side\"\n3. \"incubation room\" sign\n\nNew Mapmodels:\n1. carboard box (by dcp)\n2. storage container (by dcp)\n3. keycard (by dcp)\n4. egg (by tentus)\n5. sauerbraten video game console (by dfs)\n6. animated video monitors (by geartrooper)\n7. crystal (by tentus)\n\nNew Sounds: no\n\nSoundtrack: Original fourteen and a half minute MIDI soundrtrack by Junebug featuring SEVEN original pieces of music!\n\nExtra Credits: Special thanks to TmT of SixDogStudios for mapping the \"Hidden Shrine\" area. Extra special thanks to TmT for mapping ideas and play-testing APD3 over and over -- so we could get everything just right!\n\nHOW TO INSTALL AND PLAY:\n------------------------\nCopy the \"pacakges\" folder from this download into your main SAUERBRATEN directory.\nThis will NOT overwrite ANY existing files!\n\nStart up SAUER, hit the Tilde \"~\" key and type\n\nsp apd3\n\nNow -- KICK SOME BUTT AND GET THAT PLANT!!!\n\nMap file Sauer_SP-APD3.zip (2.7 MB)\nURL Http://www.SixDogStudios.com\nRating\n40\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Work in Progress | Singleplayer | Large (9-15)\nBlurb Foggy - a 3 part narrative based FPS/RPG/Adventure game\nScreenshot \nGet original file (539KB)\nDetailed description\n\nDescription:\n\"Foggy\" is a 3 part narrative based FPS/RPG/Adventure style game. The game contains full menu support and conditional updating of tasks, hints and narrative history. Also are options to set game difficulty and to turn off narrative pop-ups. This plays under sp mode - not under slowsp as slowsp removes the abiltity to change gamespeed which is a feature of the maps.\n\nDownloads:\nThere are two downloads for this map (ignore the singular foggy.ogz link if it appears):\n1. http://tigerleo.com/igd/cube2/foggy.zip\nThis contains the .ogz and .cfg files plus ambient sounds. THE FOLLOWING LINE NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO autoexec.cfg FOR THE MAPS TO RUN CORRECTLY (sorry for shouting):\nexec packages/base/foggyini.cfg\n\n2. http://tigerleo.com/igd/cube2/steve_e.zip\nThis contains the sound tracks - if you downloaded my \"Proof of Concept\" tech demo as discussed on the Cube Engine forum here: http://www.cubeengine.com/forum.php4?action=display_thread&thread_id=1615\nthen you do not need to download the sound tracks (unless of course you have deleted them already...;). Otherwise you will need to download both zip files (12.8MB and 21.2MB respectively)\n\nFeatures:\n* 3 maps with 4 distinct environments\n* Interactive narrative based gameplay\n* Pick-ups and 'special abilities'\n* Puzzles/mazes\n* Scripted gui help system\n* Conditional display of hints and tasks\n* Other stuff that I may have forgotten ;)\n\nDevelopment:\nThis was built over a period of 4 weeks (which was probably equivalent to 8 weeks in time) originally using the Summer Edition of Sauer then \"finished\" off using the Assassin version:\n\nThe first map, 'foggy' was my second map attempt and as such reflects very limited texturing as I was trying to see what was possible with 3 or 4 textures and mainly lighting to create the visual atmosphere.\n\nThe second map 'foggy2' was my 4th map (the 3rd being my 'proof of concept tech demo refered to above) and a rather frustrating attempt to use the heightmap tool. With the release of the Assassin Edition of Sauer I have simply not managed to suss out the new heightmap tool so 'foggy2' is rather rough and the heightmapping and texture glitches are quite apparent.\n\n'foggy3' is my 5th map that I have created and I avoided the heightmap tool and added more textures and detail. Also with the release of the Assassin Edition exploding barrels and platforms feature a fair bit in the game play.\n\nThe foggyini.cfg and foggymen.cfg files were developed to experiment with some key bindings and the gui system. Thanks to a suggestion by SheeEttin about using the gui system for conditional feedback/history etc I wanted to see how much that could be employed into the game narrative. Really, very very easy to do.\n\nMy comments:\nThe second map, foggy2 is really quite rough in parts thanks to my frustration of trying to get differing heightmapped regions to come together. Then just when you think you have it looking almost passable I would edit something and boom, the heightmaps would explode and fragment. Some areas are crying out to be touched up/fixed, but I was having little success with the Summer Edition heightmap and no success with the Assassin edition. I almost didn't include this map as it has many faults, but the map was the middle of the game narrative so it couldn't really be left out.\n\nTexturing, in general, is something that I need to pay more attention to in my next map(s). I will be avoiding heightmaps at this stage until I either get the hang of it or I grow more insane. Part of the purpose in building these maps was to use the existing textures and seeing what could be done with the cubescript itself and existing map models. I am a multimedia artist/designer, however creating textures for games is something new to me and something that I realise I have to put more time in to. The scripting on the other hand has been rather fun and despite my first reservations when looking at the syntax, it really is quite a clean language to use.\n\nSo there you have it - really another tech demo as I used this experience to try out a few things with Sauer to see what could be achieved from a game development perspective. I am glad this set of maps is finished (or almost completed) as it ended up taking on a life of its own for a while. I am now looking forward to trying out some different ideas and building some smaller single player maps to get concepts across. Cheers.\n\nUPDATE: Damn - I didn't save the first map and .cfg before submitting - these have been uploaded again - my most humble apologies...\nhttp://tigerleo.com/igd/cube2/foggy.zip\n\nUpdate 2\nFixed gui menus so that they can be switched from 2d to 3d - will not force gui2d onto the system at startup.\nInitialised variables in foggy.cfg rather than foggyini.cfg - this may solve some intialisation issues.\nhttp://tigerleo.com/igd/cube2/foggy.zip\n\nUpdate 3\nChanged the alias level_trigger_1 to 41 - that should stop any errant triggering of the book 1. But I couldn't see anything triggering that first book to pop_up... and certainly I haven't experienced of those issues. All the non opening doors are trigger 0, and every other door has a trigger starting from 5 up... I even deleted doors to see whether there was another trigger at the same place, and there is nothing in the .cfg that calls the level 1 trigger.\nhttp://tigerleo.com/igd/cube2/foggy.zip\n\nUpdate 4\nDeleted various triggers and doors from areas not accessable in the firt map, foggy.ogz - these were left over when I was developing map 1 and 3 in conjunction with each other (sorting out common geometry). Deleting these doors and triggers might be the cause of the errant triggers - they shouldn't be, but you never know as they had different trigger types associated to the trigger value to them that the 'real' tirggers in level 1 used. 8|\n\nI hope this is what the issues has been by deleting these redundant triggers and doors - fingers crossed!\n\nMap file foggy.ogz (1.85 MB)\nURL http://tigerleo.com/igd/cube2/foggy.zip\nRating\n30\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Added some atmosphere and implemented an \"intro room\", as well as some other graphical touchups and some clipping changes. Also played a bit with the lightmaps to bring the file size down by most of a meg, and repositioned some of the secrets.\n\nEdit 2.0: I have lumped all the maps into one ogz, so that they're easier to manage and play. The new mapname is t_portal, so go ahead and delete all of the old maps and cfgs, etc. This new map not only includes a new test, but some very slight changes/fixes to the existing maps, and also 10 little \"secrets\": my not-so-sneaky way of getting my commentary in there, just like the comments in portal (but not as cool, seeing as my comments are just gui text and no audio).\n\n---\n\nVery simple concept. I basically just bind MOUSE2 to pause and put you in editmode: MOUSE1 then becomes the ability to place the second \"portal\". For the third and fourth tests I bound both MOUSE1 and 2 to allow you to place both portals. Feel free to email me corrections or improvements: something has gone horribly wrong with my spellchecking stuff, and I don't have enough caffeine in the house to do it myself.\n\nThis zip contains four tests in a single ogz, mostly consisting of what used to be my portaltest, portal2, and portal3 maps. None of the tests are too difficult, but they should still provide a basis from which mappers can start working and getting ideas.\n\nMap file t_portal_2-1.zip (1.15 MB)\nRating\n66\npoints\n (9 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Was getting creative.\n\nUpdate 1/20/08\n\nNew fixes such as new lighting, 2 new hallways to different rooms, and different texturing on platforms to make the map look more less bland. In the beginning I was actually trying to make it look like the actual N64 map, but then decided to make it look better but keeping the map near to its original.\n\nThere were some rooms and platforms that were indeed very dark. So I implemented some new lighting to brighten up some rooms and platforms. But keeping the somewhat dark feel and realistic lighting to the map. I will add more soon.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nThis is a remake of Ravine from the N64 game Perfect Dark. As I've built it, I've added alot of things Sauer. This map was released before, but then was deleted by me. So I added some geometry so we all know how the platforms hang in mid air.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this map is based off a N64 map. I added nice lighting and such, but I wasn't aiming for anything spectacular. I know this map doesn't have any good gameplay but back then, there was great gameplay in this map. So maybe some old FPS players such as myself may appreciate this map.\n\nI may add on more to this map later to make the map more prettier. Such as new geometry in different rooms. But comment and tell me what exactly you think should be implemented in this map.\n\nAlso second note, I'm not the greatest mapper here. Actually, I'm not as good as any of you. You may know more stuff about mapping in Sauerbraten then I do. So give some sign of sympathy.

Enjoy :)\n\nUPDATE: Fixed some mistakes, such as the 1/4 box which looks weird (thanks to players online for spotting it). The side panels in the underground tunnel have extra height which allows you to crouch and go on it - this is probably the last update, enjoy my map :(\n\nUPDATE: Added Fog, and lightscale and recalc has been tested. Should be a bit, and I mean only a bit, but better now :)\n\nUPDATE: Fixed Lighting, prefix of the sun as 45 degree from CLA base.. lighting is set according to that, and shadows are also present now\n\nUPDATE: Tweaked a tiny bit of the map - Conveyor Belt Section\n\nUPDATE: Fixed the zip folder problem, should work finely now. Also edited the map outside, so you won't have empty spaces when you go into edit mode and press F5.\n\nOne thing before describing it, the path in the RVSF base that you cannot walk through because you hit the ceiling, is for the 0.94 release with the crouch ability. When you can crouch, you can crouch and walk through the conveyor belt. So please do not give me a low rating on that matter, I am fully aware that you cannot use the path in 0.93. I can't wait for 0.94 though :) (You could play it on CVS)\n\nI am thinking that I should suggest this map to be put into the list of maps in 0.94, mainly because I worked hard on it and pride myself about it. The crouch tunnel seems like an good idea to me, so I would keep it there. PLEASE give me suggestions, to improve this map.\n\nAwesome map, if I say so myself.. :)\nSuggestions are MOST welcome, and please enjoy this map.. Play it online with about 20 people\nYou might want to use the experimental server\n\nThe first stage release got me a good rating, with most people online rating it about 8~ out of 10\nThen I added another path to RVSF and CLA\n\nThe story is, CLA (Terrorists) have captured the safes which contain quite a sum of money, and hostages. RVSF (Government forces) have rescued the hostages with some kills and losses. Now they are ordered to kill all terrorists and retrieve the money. CLA would have to defend the money they took from the safes at all costs and if they have a chance they must seize control of the enemy base.\nIf anyone has a better story, I would use that one ^^\n\nMap file ac_storage (By SharpShooter).zip (74.49 KB)\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?9f3qyrhojom\nRating\n68\npoints\n (10 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I recently replaced king2 thanks for the base of the replacement map from Jake. This is a replacement for king4 but not because i ditched it, in fact king4 was rather good. I absolutely HATE the sci fi texture set (page 9 in texture list) and after a while I lost interest in the map. But Jake who was a co author of the map liked it so I decided to hand it over to him as long as he gave me credit for what I had already done which he promised he would do. This map is a replacement for king4, behold the new king4! It not my worst map but its definetly worse than some of my other maps. This is a quick replacement and it shows. I really didn't try on this one. I focused more on gameplay this time. Also I suck with the chosen texture set.

It has many levels and corridors and the 7 bases are very well placed. Even though it is supposed to be at night the lighting is very well done. I expect this map would be very fun to play and a good capture challenge.\n\nVersion 2.0\nA major enhancement of the map! The middle of the map has been enlarged to allow for a larger couryard between castle towers. MASSIVE details such as arches and smoothed out corners everywhere! Better texture use in many places. Drastically improved bridges and stairs. Improved ramparts (blocks on top of castle walls). More and better lighting. Some more ammo, armor, and models.\n\nSeriously, if you can get a few friends together I DEFINITELY recommend a go on this map! Not to toot my own horn but WOW I seriously love how this came out. It looks great and is a lot of fun.

It covers running jump, rifle jump, running rifle jump, MG jump, running MG jump, rocket jump, grenade jump, double grenade jump and rocket+MG jump.\n\nThere is a training section where you can just practice the jumps over and over conveniently, then there is a difficult test once you've learned the jumps. On the test, the type of weapon present indicates what weapon jump you must use to get to the next platform.\n\nThe black and silver texture line on the ground in some places indicates a jump point; you must jump there in order to gain enough speed to complete the jump.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, moving forward gives +30% speed, and jumping also gives +30% speed. So moving straight forward and jumping gives +60% speed boost.\n\nIncludes 4 demos, one of the old practice areas in a single run, a new demo for the new triple nade jump practice section, and one for each of the two test areas.\n\nAlso includes the new weapontraining map for the convenience of those who don't already have it.\n\nFor the triple nade wall jump, you have to nade jump toward the black markers on the walls. After the first nade, you have to flip around so you're going backwards, nade off the wall, then do it again against the other wall.\nBest form is get up high with the first nade and stay up as high as you can.\n\nMod file Weapontraining+Demos.zip (885.28 KB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "AssaultCube | CTF | Large (9-15) | Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA)\nBlurb This map is still under development, and suggestions are welcome - I got some random storyline, Enjoy\nScreenshot \nGet original file (185KB)\nDetailed description\n\nUPDATE: Removed all the tris.md2 and Thumbs files. Changed spawn locations, changed item spawns, added more mapmodels.\n\nUPDATE: Added Toca's Mapmodels, Storyline (not much, I guess), Night Version Available now, More space for CLA base\n\nStoryline:\n\nIt was boring guarding the perimeter. A week has passed since they captured these office buildings. They've been using it as a communication and information centre for their terroist movement; the anti-terrorist group hasn't noticed their activities - yet. They hijacked the local radio and is voicing propaganda through it to join us (CLA).\nSo far, its been successful. Village men in this country are rebelling, and already attacked a prison where our comrades were captured. They've escaped and managed to make it to our temporaily HQ. Our comrades who returned are proffessionals. They were trained since their childhood. The only reason they were captured by the stupid anti-terrorist government forces were because our leader told them to surrender so we can escape. We escaped while the comrades were surrendering. The only reason the leader valued our group, was because we were technicians. CLA needed more educated technicians, and we were the only ones that could operate and hack into computers, hijack radio channels and the such.\nMe and one other guy named Bernadino were playing cards while discussing how boring it was sitting out in the freezing cold and guarding. Bernadino was a nice guy. He was only 16 years old when he joined us. It's only been a month since then.\nI suddenly felt a punch in my chest, and heard a sound that sounded like an bird swooping by. It winded me... I looked back to see who did it. There was no one. Suddenly, it felt extremely cold...and when I turned back Bernadino looked terrified. Blood was spatterd on the ground and on the cards. I couldn't speak.. so I pointed at Bernadino's walkie-talkie. Bernadino got the idea, and as soon as his hand reached it his head exploded. Damn, I thought. I couldn't think straight... my vision was whitening.\n\n*The RVSF sniper, Eagle, searched the ground for other guards. He saw none, and he radioed in the other team it was safe to go. The rest of the team moved towards the office buildings. One of them code-named Bear shot the barely alive terrorist in the head with a silenced pistol.\nThey passed through the garage door silently. It was midnight, but the part of the office occupied by the CLA were brightly lit. The team then followed the set plan - to gather intelligence for the location of the CLA leader, and if possible eliminate all CLA threats within the vicinity. It was hard to determine with the satellite images they've taken before the misson, but it was possible there were some hostages. If so, it was also their mission to rescue them.\nThey crept into the shadows, and approached the office buildings.*\n\n~This story is based on the night version of ac_offices, ac_officesn~\n\nI am not strictly following the CS version, only using CS version as an base/idea.\n\nDon't forget that this maps still under development, so don't rate me harsh - I will detail it later.\nThe mapmodel pics.. what do you think of them? :0\n\nOh and all the windows - you can crouch through them in 0.94\nIt will increase player mobility throughout the map. Yep, even the desks.\n\n(Try throwing nades through some of the skymaps)\n\nMap file ac_offices.zip (3.42 MB)\nRating\n20\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

(18/3/07)\n=================\n\nFixed up Licence\n=================\n\nPosting here all the README file (it covers all aspects):\n\n********\nREADME:\n********\n\n**************************\nJord's Custom Mod Pack 2.\n**************************\nReleased 16th March 2008.\n**************************\n\nOriginal Models (Such as Barrel, Mait Sign) have been skinned and modelled by MakkE.\nThese models have only been edited by Jord.\n\n-----------\nQuick Chat\n-----------\n\nQuick chat is made by Jord, and can be found under Multiplayer, Quick Chat menu in\nAssaultCube.\n\nThe Commands for Quick Chat include:\n\nIncoming!\nSorry!\nWatch out!\nLol!\n:)\n:(\n:\\\n\nA sub-menu in Quick Chat is Team Tactical Chat. These chat messages include:\n\nFire at Will!\nCease Fire\nFall In\nRegroup\nStop TEAMKILLING me!\nFollow me\nCover me!\nI'm going for the flag!\nFire in the Hole!\nI have the flag, don't shoot me!\n\nThis Quick Chat feature has also been binded to the F1 key, for even easier and quicker access.\n\n---------------------------------------\nCustom Map Models (Originals By MakkE)\n---------------------------------------\n\nThese mapmodels have been custom made off of MakkE's models.\n\n--\n\nYes, these are the same map models as in Jord's Custom Mod Pack 1, but are here for you to use.\nHowever, there are 2 new ones, and the originals are by makkE, of course.\n\nThe new ones are:\nElectric Sign\nPoisonous Barrel\n\nAll of the map models are available in the Menu under Editing > Mapmodels.\n\n-----\nMenu\n-----\n\nIn the menu.cfg, there is some new features. With the Quick Chat, some fix-ups and a new menu to help new players\nwho are new to the game and at being master. This menu has a quick guide showing how to set up a map and mode.\n\nThis is available under Multiplayer > Change Map/Mode > Help... or Multiplayer > Change Map/Mode > [Any] > Other...\n\nAlso, there is a Key Bind for the Quick Chat menu (as said above) which is F1, which will automaticly pop-up the\nQuick Chat menu in-game.\n\nA fix that I have done is in the Editing > Pickups I have added Grenades, so you don't have to keep typing /newent\ngrenades 1 all the time.\n\n----------\nKey Binds\n----------\n\nThere are some key binds that you may find useful in this mod pack.\nThese key binds are:\n\nF1 - Open Quick Chat menu\nF12, Print Screen - Take a screenshot\nF4, M - Get map (also clears secure maps)\nF2 - Open Team Tactical Chat menu\n\n--------------\n[Mapname].cfg\n--------------\n\nThis config file is for you to copy and use for any map. This includes all mapmodels in it. Where the [mapname]\nis goes your map's name, of course, and take out the brackets. Then paste it in the packages/maps folder.\n\n*IMPORTANT*\nIf you do this, make sure you send the .cfg file and your extras with your map, so every other user has the right adjustments for\nyour map!\n\n---------\nTextures\n---------\n\nThere are also some custom textures in this mod pack, made by Jord (me). Please refer to the 'Permissions' document in\nthe folder with the textures 'Jord folder' if you want to use my textures.\n\nThese textures are:\n\ngrass - Just a tropical looking fresh grass texture.\nbitumen_with_leaves - A greyish road with autumn leaves on it.\nleafs - A texture full of autumn leaves (good for making a pile of autumn leaves).\nbitumen - A normal road or path texture.\ngrass2 - A darker, more dense version of grass (above).\nred - A plain red.\nblue - A plain blue.\ngreen - A plain green.\nyellow - A plain yellow.\n\n-----------\nCrosshairs\n-----------\n\nIn this mod pack, there are also some crosshairs, which are available under Player Setup > Set Crosshair menu in-game.\n\nThese crosshairs are:\n\n+_dot.png\ntri_cross.png\ntri_cross_with_dot.png\nX-cross.png\n+_dot(green).png\n+_dont(blue).png\n-------------------------------------------\nQuestions, Comments, problems or Feedback?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, problems or feedback, please don't hesitate to email me:\njordancomley@hotmail.com\n\nBut please, so I do not recognize it as spam, put the subject:\n'Jord's Custom Mod Pack 2'\n\n********\nCredits\n********\n\nOriginal Map models by MakkE.\n\nThanks to all who have given comments thouought the time that I have been making this mod pack - really have\ngiven me confidence.\n\nThanks to all who have suggested ideas, and hopefully they are in this mod pack, or future ones!\nThanks, and Have fun!\n\nMod file Jord's Custom Mod Pack v2.zip (2.48 MB)\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?yyjlst0olpy\nRating\n28\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Other | Public Domain\nBlurb A workflow for Macs that allows you to convert one or more .bak files to .ogz files. Note: You can only get it from my website.\nDetailed description\n\nHave you ever accidentally saved over a great level you were working on? It happens mostly when you name your levels with numbers. If you did happen to accidentally save over a level you were working on, you can always use the .baks that Sauerbraten creates whenever you save your map. However, you have to convert your .baks to .ogzs to be able to open them in Sauerbraten. Converting them manually can take a lot of time. You would have to rename them one at a time. Now that has changed. You no longer need to manually convert each .bak file to a .ogz file one by one. With this workflow, you can pick the .bak files you want to convert then, with a single click, convert them all to .ogz files.\n\nHow to install: Installing is simple. Just put it wherever you want. As far as I know, it doesn't have to be in a specific place.\n\nHow to use: All you have to do is click the add button under the heading \"Get Specified Finder Items,\" then locate the .bak files you want to convert. To select multiple files just hold down control. When you have the .baks you want to convert selected, push \"add.\" The file selection window should close. Then just push the button that says run under it. You don't have to type anything under the heading \"Replace Finder Items.\" When you push the run button, the .bak files you specified are turned into .ogz files. That's all you have to do.\n\nNote: This workflow only works on Macs. You also must have Automater.\nNote 2: You can only download the workflow from my website because the file type is not supported on Quadropollis.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nURL http://e.macsrule.googlepages.com/bakto.ogz\nRating\n2\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

The content stored here may not reflect the copy the game uses.\nBlurb Private Stan Sauer Returns\nScreenshot \nGet original file (82KB)\nDetailed description\n\nHello to the Sauerbraten community!\n\nI have a new single player SAUERBRATEN map pack called \"Private Stan Sauer: Run n' Gun\". If you've played any early mpsp series maps, you'll know what to expect!\n\nGet it here:\n\nhttp://chronicfatiguemusic.com/mpsp9_final.zip\n\nOr visit the website here and look around:\n\nhttp://chronicfatiguemusic.com\n\nThis is a rather large download, approximately 25mb. The map pack contains the following:\n\n1. (3) single player maps (mpsp9a, mpsp9b, mpsp9c)\n\n2. 200+ new MitaMAN textures (including normal and spec maps) along with a few new and reworked textures from the loopix, noctua, and g-pack texture collections.\n\n3. Mask textures for several of the mitaman models included from the original \"Army of One\" (mpsp6) map pack.\n\n4. New doors, fence, elevator and floor board mitaman models.\n\n5. Several DCP models (light, grates, switch, etc...) that were not part of any CUBE or Sauerbraten release.\n\n6. A texture/model config template (mpsp9_template.cfg) to make it easy to use the new textures / models in your own map.\n\nI tried to make the textures as \"real world looking\" as possible. They should prove very useful for modern-day as well as RPG type maps. The textures are high resolution, most 512x512, and scaled down to half or quarter size in the map configuration to maintain detail.\n\nIf you like more \"shiny-plastic\" looking textures change the following setting in the map configs:\n\nfrom: setpixelparam 1 2 2 2\n\nto: setpixelparam 1 4 4 4\n\nThis map will push your system hard in some areas. There are many explosions, items that move, outdoor water areas, and elevators. I used most of what the engine has to offer map builders.\n\nTake care of what you shoot at! Sometimes you'll find stuff after an explosion - BOOM!\n\nExtract the \"mpsp9_final.zip\" file into your Sauerbraten folder (not \"packages\" folder). Some of the files from the original mpsp6 (Army Of One) map pack will be over-written. Don't worry, it's just improved model textures and md2 configs. YOUR SAUERBRATEN INSTALL WILL NOT GET MESSED UP!\n\nALL NEW TEXTURES ARE IN THE packages/mpsp9 FOLDER IN THEIR OWN SUB-DIRECTORY.\n\nTo play the map, open the console, type \"sp mpsp9a\" (without quotes) and press enter. Then Run, Gun, and have fun!\n\nAny feedback on this map would be great.\n\nMitaMAN (aka Mike Poeschl)\n\nURL http://chronicfatiguemusic.com\nRating\n86\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

ElevatorMenus lets you easily create elevators without typing anything. You can pick any of the three mapmodels on the menu. You can now also set the speed and tag of the elevator. Of course, this isn't the only way to add elevators in the game. It is just an easy way for beginners to add elevators. Please comment on this, as I would like to see how people feel about it.\n\nHow to install: Create a document called autoexec.cfg, and a document called elevators.cfg. Place the autoexec.cfg into your Sauerbraten folder, and the elevators.cfg into your data folder. Next copy and paste the following into the autoexec.cfg: exec data/elevators.cfg. Then copy and paste the code on the page that comes up when you click on the link \"config file\" into the elevators.cfg. And that's it. Now you can easily create elevators in Sauerbraten.\n\nWhat's new in version 1.1:\n\n1. You can now set the speed and tag of elevators you create with this menu.\n\n2. SkyMenus no longer comes with this menu.\n\n3.

The idea is this is an energy center that, well, stores energy. This map is good for insta, capture and deathmatch. Please download it and tell me what you think of it.\n\nThanks to everyone who has helped make this map possible, you know who you guys are.\n\nP.S. I wasn't able to get a good screenshot on here but this one managed to work. This shot was from a older and worse version of the map, so please download the map to see what it actually looks like.\n\nUPDATE: I have made some new changes to this map. The most obvious change is that most of the floors are now made of glass. I have also added more lights to dark places, more weapons and health and have fixed other small bugs. Please check out the new version and see what you think.\n\nAlso, how can I update this map so that people will be able to see the update on the front page of quad?\n\n-Ace\n\nMap file ace2.zip (2.32 MB)\nRating\n68\npoints\n (10 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This map is the first entry in what I hope will be a series of 3 similarly themed maps (fingers crossed). While the map is moderately large, movement times between each base are fast. Although there are a number of hallways twisting through the map, care was taken to keep the learning curve moderate: the map is wrapped around a central pit that is frequently visible, and you are never more than a few steps away from a scene that lets you see the sky (both to provide a sense of where you are, and to keep things from feeling too \"lost in the bunker\").\n\nThere are a few aspects of the map to note:\n\n-I broke my own rule, and have three (count 'em, three!) flags that are nearly overlapped on the radar. Bad Satan!\n\n-While I know it's not common to do so, the map contains two drop-to-your-death areas that are covered with natural terrain instead of openness or lava. While I know this will raise a few eyebrows, my thinking is that a user would rapidly learn and get used to this aspect, and no problem related to it would persist. I didn't want to use lava in this map in the central pit, nor have an infinite-droppoff in the little canyon outside. So, I decided to take some creative liberties on that front.\n\n-I very much would have loved to spend more time on the interior lighting, and on the skybox. However, I feel I need to blaze on ahead to my next map, so decided to wrap this map up and call it good enough.\n\n-As this is my first submission to Quad, I do hope I haven't messed up my packaging or any other aspect of this submission. Please give a shout if anything is awry.\n\nI look forward to hearing your comments, and thanks for taking a moment to check the map out.\n~SATAN!!!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis regen/capture/ffa map was created mainly using Lunaran's excellent q4power texture set. The skybox used is a slightly reorded (so the sun is in the right spot) series created by Dash, found at the Wadfather site. Thanks Lunaran and Dash!\n\nThis map requires a build greater-than the \"Assassin Edition\" version of Cube2/Sauerbraten.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI am very thankful for a whole host of people who offered sound advice, encouragement, and excellent feedback, including:\neihrul\nDrakker\nHirato\nNieb\nDemosthenes\nPbrane\nclan The Conquerors in general, and in particular:\nSchmutzwurst\nAndi\nJorge\nHero\nand all the fine people in #sauerbraten channel on the QuakeNet IRC network.\n\n... and thanks quin for getting me sorted out on screenshots!\n\nMap file access.zip (2.63 MB)\nRating\n206\npoints\n (23 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Finally they decide to attack from the underground.\n\nTHE FACTS:\n\n- traditional 8-layout\n- two ways crossing in the center of the map\n- each base got two entries\n- recommended for ctf\n- .cfg file included (changes fog, -edit- )\n_________________________________________________________\n\nUPDATE:\n\n- removed unnecessary information from the config file\n- added some little details in one spot (I would be very surprised if someone finds that ;)\n- added/refined pickups\n\nUPDATE:\n\n- config fixed\n- some flaws fixed\n- added some details and mapmodels\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFinal release for the current ac-version. Thanks to everybody!!! Have fun!\n\nMap file ac_keller.zip (29.22 KB)\nURL http://www.misterfloppy.de.vu\nRating\n104\npoints\n (13 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

The content stored here may not reflect the copy the game uses.\n*\n*\nStarred Content\nBlurb Quite large, mirrored CTF map with various possible ways\nScreenshot \nGet original file (48KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThe map is already in the CVS tree - get recent version from there :)\n\n2mach1 is the name of the original map from Quake.\nWahnFred showed me the map and asked whether it would be possible to sauerize it, so we started working.\n\nI did most of the work, nearly everything with geometry, texturing and lighting due to the circumstance that Wahn never mapped before. I tought him a bit during the mapping sessions.\nBut he helped a lot with ideas and critics, so he deserved a credit here :)\n\nThe map is a pure CTF map. I spread some playerstarts for other gamemodes, but mainly it's thought to play CTF in it.\nIt has a highly secure spawn room with ammo and two teleporters in it, one for offense and one for defense players. They are marked by mapmodels (an axe and a shield - thanks to eihrul for that idea.)\nYou have 4 ways to get to the flagroom and out again.\nBeneath the middle part between the castles are some tunnels you can walk through, above is some stuff.\n\nMany things in this map aren't in the 12-year-old (iirc) quake map. I think, you can imagine how detailed that one was? ;)\nWe added a lot of different stuff there. The center is complete made-in-sauer, the spawnroom, and so on. We just took the great layout of the older map.\n\nSome notes, before you are commenting/suggesting/whatever:\n- the jumppads are best how they are now\n- I have no idea how to solve that heightmap-lighting-problem. (You can see the problem in the water somewhere, mainly)\n\nBefore I forget it: thanks to SATAN with his lighting-hints, eihrul, Nieb, apfl, schmutz and others who put some comments on that map already :)\n\nUpdate:\nAdded a few details and removed useless materials.\n\nUpdate No.2:\nAdded a little more details and some mapmodels, uncluding an axe to mark the offensive teleporter. Removed the O/D-Signs.\n\nUpdate No.3:\nNieb, eihrul (thanks a lot, you two!) and me redesigned the rockwalls and the ground. You shouldn't notice it, but it has now way less triangles, as you can see in the filesize falling down to 670 kb. :)\nI also added a small room in the map.\n\nUpdate No. 3.1:\nlittle bugfix\n\nUpdate No. 3.1:\nupdated some text here. I'm not gonna update the map here since it's in CVS (no need there, I guess)\n\nAnd: Thanks for the comments here :)\n\nEDIT: Mmh, can't upload the new screenie...\nhttp://fdbdownloads.fd.ohost.de/Sauerbraten/mach2.jpg\n\nMap file mach2.zip (684.83 KB)\nRating\n124\npoints\n (16 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

XD), and do /map newtokyo\n\n- First uploaded to quadropolis.us on 18 May 2008.\n\n- I regularly used 4-16 lights where I could probably have used 1 in pursuit of a certain effect, and if this is the cause of the relatively large filesize I apologise for the silliness... but if you're having trouble fitting it on a floppy disk, or the level has some sort of notably large loading time on your computer it is your problem...\n\n- While the map title may invoke images of an urban environment, futuristic or otherwise, this was merely an idea that served as inspiration. Although I ultimately ended up with a slightly less literal interpretation, one can still observe the nature of the original idea throughout the map (e.g. 'bright city lights', buildings, a 'downtown', a 'warehouse district' etc.). PLUS urban maps are just silly =(.\n\n- I would suggest no more than 4 play DM or instagib on this level, but I don't really enjoy playing anything other than (co-op)edit and 4-or-less instagib, so... see what works for you =). You can probably fit in a few more...\n\n- Some early feedback I received highlighted the initially confusing arrangement of teleports. Simply: there are a few teleports directly below and facing the towers they teleport in/out of, there are a few teleports used where I found the jumppad sound silly, a few teleports at the ends of simple paths to create interesting chase scenarios, and a one-way teleport away from the underground quad.\n\n- I usually take some time trying to do weapons and playerstarts... but this time I didn't XD. Feedback in this area would be especially appreciated.\n\n- All feedback really is appreciated... but please be nice =P.\n\n- You may share this work, in a non-commercial capacity, and may do so only if I am credited as the creator. You may not edit the work.

As you can see, I still need to:\n- add pickups\n- redo lights\n- add details\n\nBackstory: An RVSF informant in the CLA has given the counter-terrorists the location of a small terrorist base in Eastern Europe, codenamed \"Cheetah\". The RVSF quickly sent a unit to the area to kill all terrorists there. Unfortunately, they were ambushed upon their arrival. The CLA had known that they were coming; the informant had been found out by the CLA, who had tortured him until he revealed what he had told the RVSF. The RVSF unit was killed, being made up of only four operatives. A much larger detachment of counter-terrorists was sent to the CLA base to destroy it.\n\nCredit to Toca for mapmodels and to Wotwot and makkE for the textures. As you may have found out, I used ac_urban's (the CVS version) .cfg file, modified slightly, for this.\n\nMap file ac_ambush_beta.zip (2.43 MB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

On each island is a medium-sized sci-fi castle of sorts, and a watchtower. There are several secret areas, but they are pretty well easy to find, so gameplay should not be affected too severely.

Each area is designed to be easily protected.\nIE: the machine gun base is protected by a sort of Vauban's fortification;\nthe shotgun base is attainable by sinuous and narrow ways;\nthe rifle base is up in a tower, that provide a good field of view on all the map;\nthe rocket base is on a raised block in a lava cave, and can be reach by jumping from block to block (designed to be difficult when someone is shooting rockets at you)\nthe grenade base allows indirect fire on incoming oponents, using bouncing on geometry and shooting under a glas wall;\nand finally for the pistol, there is two bases close enought to get life and armor twice fast as usual in regen capture. A good hospital.\n\nThe map isn't really good looking because I was unable to give to all this stuff a coherent look.\n\nI am dazed by the weight of the map file, but I hadn't find how to optimize it yet. I destroyed all the envmap, turn lod off, optimize geometry, etc, and I still have a 2MB file for a 9k vertices/18k triangles map, with not so many lights. Moreover, there could be a matter with the skybox, but I don't understand what's wrong with my cfg...\nThen I put it in beta version because it is not well polished, but this it is very close too the final release of this map.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Work in Progress | CTF | Large (9-15) | Copyright\nBlurb Space has gone to hell\nScreenshot \nGet original file (429KB)\nDetailed description\n\nCTF remake of an old map of mine. A lot of the geometry has been changed from the original not to mention some new parts have been added in. Right now the release of this only contains the geometry but I am trying to get a feel for what players would like to see done with this to better fit how they play.\n\nThe current concept is that from flag-to-flag there are more or less 5 paths (2 top, 2 middle, 1 bottom) that a player can take. The top is the fastest by far but provides little cover. The middle path gives a good bit of cover but getting to the flag takes some work. The bottom path is very open and very straight so it can be either a quick escape or just a fast way to die.\n\nUPDATE 1:\nI will now call this a beta version of the map. A few geometry changes to make the time between flags a bit longer. The lighting is done and items and spawns are all in place. As of right now all I need on this map is a bit of testing and refining before I will call it done. If there are any changes anyone would like to see in this let me know and I will see if I can toss them in. The map is intended mainly for CTF so the placement of weapons is sided more towards the spawns of the map but I managed to place the regular spawns out quite evenly so that they are within easy reach of some weaponry.\n\nUPDATE 2:\nWidened the side hallway a lot. This took a lot of time and I think it worked out well. I don't plan to widen the other hallways as they are much shorter and benefit from the narrowness in this case. I took out a lot of the small pillars to give the map a little more open feel and also raised a few areas where the ceiling was too low. Teleports have been added in to make getting between levels just a tad faster.\n\nUPDATE 3: Okay I just tore through the map and removed as much obstructions as I felt the map could do without. This is about as far as I can take the map to make it more open. There will be at least one update after this to tie up a few loose ends such as adding Capture and a new screenshot as well.\n\nUPDATE 4:\nAddition of small visual changes to the map as well as a few texture fixes. The large side hallway now is connected between the top and bottom to improve the flow of the map a bit as well as give a little more in the way of paths to take to the flag. Capture support added in and new screenshot is now packaged with it.\n\nUPDATE 4.5:\nTossed in a teleporter in each side to help with getting to the upper levels and also made it so that grabbing the flag will be just a tad harder but not too much.\n\nUPDATE 5:\nI think the change is obvious. I think it improves the map quite a bit by giving more options of where to go and at the same time increasing the chance of a run in between teams and also allowing for a better chance at getting the flag back should it be captured.\n\nUPDATE 6:\nAdded in some particle effects by request. Some might get changed or removed on the next update. About 1/4 of the envmaps are now gone to reduce a little bit of the drag they were causing.\n\nUPDATE 7:\nThe end is near!!! A few texture and geometry fixes. The major update here is less noticable as it is the reduction of the envmaps down to a more reasonable level. From edit mode look above the map and you will see how this was all done.\n\nMap file redemption.zip (1.48 MB)\nRating\n66\npoints\n (8 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Also some manipulated glowmaps.\n\nThe texturing isn't the best; I started out with just the gray metal plate that you see near the center, then had a sudden inspiration and went on a retexturing rampage with the Lunaran's textures. The end result isn't half bad, but I suppose I still have a bit to learn about detail work. :)\n\nThe map is built around two opposing \"control\" areas, each a base for a CTF flag.

Surprisingly, this one may be pleasing to your eyes. I present to you, Crayon Wars. As goofy as a name as it is, it fits I believe. This was inspired by Redon's map in the making, Guacamole CTF. The texture set, just intrigued me. Anyway, the map uses the boxtex textures. When i designed the map, i had something like... what you may see in a kid's imagination, or a drawing perhaps just coming to life, if that makes any sense to anyone. The map consists of two castle/forts separated by a river. This is purely a CTF map. Attempting to play in other modes, will cause a mass mosh pit in the water. =P If you really want other game modes, just say so, and ill adapt the map accordingly, but just setting foot in the map screams CTF. A special thanks for Mr.Biggles for the designing of the trees, and slight detail and some texturing, and odds and ends. I hope everybody who downloads this finds it enjoyable. OH! And a big surprise for Meatrome. I ACTUALLY packaged a map correctly! I'm proud of my self, arent you? ;P\n\nUpdate 1:Updated the map with some modifications from Biggles. 1.The ramparts now have some nice support beams, and theres some poles on the sniper towers. Also, the zip file is NOW correctly packaged. =P\n\nUpdate 2: Improved the geometry of the castle towers, and biggles completely redid the flag room. It can now be described as a \"Dr. Seussy\" throne room type thing =P\nBiggles and I also Made new bridges: 1 big one in the middle for assaults, but provides little cover, and 2 smaller ones, one on each side. These are for flank attacks, and provide maximum cover, except for rockets. Still no Capture mode support, but i fortunately added in standard spawnpoints for other game modes such as instagib, and FFA. Be sure and leave us a comment to tell us how were doing. =]\n\nMap file crayonwars.zip (446.98 KB)\nRating\n74\npoints\n (10 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Work in Progress | Capture | CTF | Large (9-15) | Creative Commons (BY)\nBlurb A large map in a valley pitting two large forts against each other.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (88KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThis map is my second release (although it is my 5th real map) and I'm very proud of it. I invested more time into this map than I have for all of my others. ValleyForts is intended for CTF, but can also be played equally well in Capture or Regen Capture.\n\nThe map is based in a valley, split into two sides by a river running through the center. Two castles run the length of each side, each has four large battlements which give segmented views of the map. The layout of the map causes the player to cross sides at up to five points to reach the other base (alternate routes may cause this to differ). In the exact center of the map is a building which marks where the \"territory\" of each side ends. In the middle of the building there is no floor save for a small arena, which houses a capture base in the capture gamemode.\n\nOverall, this is a large CTF castle-themed map with expansive bases and caverns. It is by far my most visually stimulating map and may not run extremely fast on lower-end computers. I enjoyed making it and I hope that you'll enjoy playing it :D\n\nHope you love it and PLEASE comment!\n\nMap file valleyforts.zip (7.23 MB)\nRating\n38\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Please read it before using any of these textures.\n\nI have asked for permission of the author and am releasing this mod/pack. I will release more soon.\nTo explain throughly, I didn't just receive the images and put it in the pack. I have renamed all the images accordingly, adjusted the pictures so they are properly arranged according to its cameras (rotating pictures to fit etc.), and test every single one in AC.\nThere shouldn't be any problems, but if you do encounter them, please leave a comment of what precisely happened.\nAlso, just to let you know, ScentedNectar is not an FPS player or anything. She makes art for fun, should I say.\n\n-------------->Non-Mappers Read This!!!<--------------\nIf you do not know how to load skymaps and/or do not want to make your own maps using these skymaps but want to use them in your normal gameplay, type in the following command to load the skyboxes during gameplay\n\n/loadsky \"textures/skymaps/nectar/nectarX\"\n\nand so on. X is the digit which will determine what skybox to load out of the 16 there is. So, if you wish to load skybox 6, type in\n\n/loadsky \"textures/skymaps/nectar/nectar6\"\n\nThis probably only works for Windows. If there are other ways to do it on Linux or Mac, please tell me. Also, if you're good with config, you may re-edit it so it will load these textures automatically for you on particular maps. Binding is another option. Contact me for more info about this.\n_______________________________________________\nBelow are screenshot previews of my soon-to-be map, ac_say (be aware that ac_say is an temporaily name)\n\nhttp://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc117/Tickytac1/screenshot_162155.jpg\nhttp://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc117/Tickytac1/screenshot_217091.jpg\nhttp://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc117/Tickytac1/screenshot_265676.jpg\nhttp://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc117/Tickytac1/screenshot_93430.jpg\n\nMod file Nectarskymaps.zip (9.09 MB)\nRating\n40\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "AssaultCube | Artistic | Singleplayer | Creative Commons (BY)\nBlurb Space + Zombies + AC? Awesome!\nScreenshot \nGet original file (156KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThis isn't really meant to be played - it's sorta just a work of art. Oh, sure, I added RVSF and CLA spawns, so it can be played. But it was really just trying to see if a 'future' map might work, as several people on the AC forum when discussing the 2nd Mapping Competition thought that making a futuristic map would be impossible. And it fits nicely with the 2nd Comp itself, although I cannot enter it because I am a judge, which was determined to be a ship-based thing. I also made quite a little short story to go a long with it.\n\nMay The Frag Be With You. [ well, a gib is preferred ]\n\nBACKSTORY: [ warning: this is a bit long ] [ you might notice a few references in it to the AC community and various other things :P ]\nLieutenant Gerald Gimmick looked at the terminal. A message had just arrived from some RVSF base on an asteroid. He pressed a few keys and it opened:\n\nCommanders Log: Entry 4442\nWell, after a long and very, very, VERY boring 12 years of nothing much worth mentioning, something has finally happened. A ship that looks like a piece of crap just crashlanded on our asteroid near the base, in a small crater.\n\nSending a team of RVSF specialists to investigate.\n\nCommanders Log: Entry 4443\nWe lost communication with the RVSF operatives when they entered the ship, after blowing open the doorways with charges. I sent another team and the same happened. I am sure as hell not going down there myself . . there's something fishy. I'm ordering all doors to be locked securely.\n\nCommanders Log: Entry 4444\nThere was a hammering on the door last night shortly after I transmitted my last log. We opened it to find one of the RVSF. He had scratches and bites all over him. We asked him what had happened and then interrogated him but he said nothing, just stared at a wall.\n\nCommanders Log: Entry 4445\nA lot of the doors mysteriously opened last night. Now they can't close. We put the survivor in a cell, but I'm getting my men to get ready for an attack. I will be transmitting all logs since the ship crashed to Command.\n\nCommanders Log: Entry 4446\nOh God. We got attacked yesterday evening by a bunch of . . I don't know what to call them. Zombies. They were all pale and bloody, and they were wearing torn up RVSF uniforms. I'm beginning to think some sort of virus was in that ship. We killed most of them, and then they ran away.\n\nCommanders Log: Entry 4447\nEveryone who was wounded in yesterdays skirmish started turning all gray today, and becoming violent. One attacked a man. Oh, there's one at the door now. He's holding his arms out in front of him and walking towards meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeecdxfsxdersxxxxxz sorry about that. I can't delete the stuff; my elbow fell on the keyboard. I shot the man, but he bit me. I fear I might, too, join the undead, for there are no other words for them . . .\n\n[ There are no more Logs ]\n\nGimmick looked up for a moment before pressing a few more keys on the terminal's keyboard. A face appeared on the monitor, of Lieutenant General Makke. \"Yes?\" the face asked him, the gruff voice of Makke sounding slightly annoyed. This was compounded by the downward slant of the Lieutenant Generals bushy eyebrows.\n\"Sir, there's a transmission from Base 0666. Ah . . you might want to see it.\"\n\"Put it in.\"\nLieutenant Gimmick pressed a few *more* keys. The stern visage of Makke looked down at something below the screen for a while. Then he looked up and said, \"Send several teams of RVSF immediately.\"\n- - -\n\nSergeant \"Dancin' Dog\" Cole of M Platoon looked around, his MTP-57 slung across his back. This place was a mess. Blood all over the walls and floor. Shotgun shells lying around. A crate of ammunition had been torn open, the contents spilling across the floor around it. Some doors were forced open and barrels were piled in makeshift barricades. \"Lieutenant Harps - you seeing this crap?\"\n\"Ya,\" replied Harps. \"let's take a look at the ship. There are four entrances. Cole, prepare to enter the SW entrance. Master Sergeant Floppy, take the north-western. Gunnery Sergeant Rowan, get the NE. Sergeant Diana, I'm pretty sure you can figure out which one you get.\"\n\"Sir, yes, sir,\" answered the various sergeants. The reply wasn't too enthusiastic.\n\"Corporal Shadow, I want you covering the entrances to the ship.\" Shadow was a dead shot with the sniper rifle. \"The rest of you, you know your sergeants, get with them.\"\n\"Sir, yes, sir!\"\n\"Uh, sir?\" this was Private Casey, or \"KC\". \"there's this thing, like, a gray human guy. He has blood all over him, and he just bit Deadeye. And he looks like he's going to bite me, too - \" a gunshot echoed \"Uh, mind if I, sorta, killed him, a bit? And Deadeye is looking a bit, odd. There's like, white stuff. Coming out of his lips. And he's mumbling, 'brainsbrainsbrainsbrainsbrains'. Real fast-like. What should I do?\"\n\"Er . . . \"\nHarps was interrupted by PFC \"Emo\" Poser. \"Er, sir? There's another one. Just like Kay Cee - \" it was pronounced as two separate words. \" - said. And, er, it's like, all over Floppy. And Intel,\" Corporal Intel was a notoriously annoying person who spammed up the communications device. He was also somewhat vain; he had taken to calling himself 'majestic' recently. \"And Private Tipper. What should I do?\"\n\"Well, shoot it, of course,\" replied Harps.\n\"Oh wait, nevermind. Some random idiot just came and whacked it with a plank, and it sorta fell off of them.\"\n\"Hey, there's another one of them. Actually, there's about . . . two dozen . . . \"\n\"EVERYONE RETREAT! GET BACK TO DA CHOPPAH!\" yelled Harps. \"I mean hangah,\" he amended himself, and started to run. Once they got to the passageway leading to the hanger, where they had landed with a transport, they saw that the door was held open with a barrel; while usually this would work to their advantage, but M Platoon was not to good at figuring out things like that and thus it was assumed that the barrel meant that the door was being held closed. \"Well, men,\" said Harps, \"and women - \" he noticed a sharp look from Sergeant Diana - \"We shall just ha - \" he was interrupted by a heated stare from a small blue fuzzy ball. Corporal ElCol was not considered human by most of his companions and Harps was beginning to realize that perhaps they were correct. \" - ah, men and women and small blue fuzzy things, we shall have to make a stand here and hope help arrives.\"\n\nAnd thus the epic battle for survival, epic-ness, and pie began . . . it is said that the first shot was from a local SHOOP which had been hovering above the asteroid in space.\n\nMap file ac_crashed.zip (2.69 MB)\nRating\n78\npoints\n (10 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Most walls and ceilings are partially or completely destroyed along the edges of the canal, with more complete structures found near the center of each base. Trenches, narrow ledges and stairs, bunkers, and lots of sniping. There is no 'perfect cover', no matter where you might choose to hole up, you can get shot from almost anywhere, so stay alert!\n\nThe level is so big and open that opposite sides of the map are shrouded in distance fog...however, this prevents extreme range sniping and encourages getting into the trenches with a shotgun.\n\nWindows on the RVSF base don't render well when viewed from the CLA flag area. Sometimes the engine renders columns at a distance that should not be there either.\n\nThere aren't many map models yet, and I'm still getting the grasp of sloped surfaces. If anyone is interested in helping me flesh out the level in coopedit or wants to build off of it on their own, let me know.\n\nMap file ac_ruinedcities.zip (16.65 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Comes with the grappling hook addition.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (61KB)\nDetailed description\n\nFor those of you who remember the good old Freezetag mod and Grappling hook from Quake 1/2/3 days, we've recreated them for your Cubing pleasure! Grapple can be used in any game mode, and FT in any team play game mode.\n\n--- Addendum ---\nSince I didn't think to post instructions here, I'll just copy in Gindrex' note from the comments and add a few qualifiers:\n**\n\nIf you use the included modified batch files/config you shouldn't need to do much to actually turn it on, other than switch to a multiplayer mode like insta team dm.\n**\n(Altrag notes: FT is only available in team games, not regular DM games. Grapple is available in all modes. Also, the pre-built executable is ftsauer.exe, not sauerbraten.exe. Recompiling will overwrite the original sauerbraten.exe filename however. ftserver.bat and ftsauer.bat are your two basic batch files to run ftsauer. I've also changed the default port to 38785 and added a -mnomaster option in the batch file so that I wouldn't be polluting the master server with untested code. Keep that in mind if you want to start a server for non-LAN players).\n**\n\nBasically, the ftserver batch file will start it with freeze turned on internally.\n**\n(Altrag notes: FT and grapple were intended to be votable options, but I haven't gotten the voting working correctly yet, so for the moment they're both hardcoded on the server side. You will have to recompile to disable them. Voting is still planned for the future however).\n**\n\nThen all you need to do is connect the corresponding client to it. Once you change to a multiplayer mode like insta team dm, etc, it will pull the mode from the server and turn it on.\n\nOf course, you need at least 3 clients before it starts getting more fun, since a single player per team results in a team score and autothaw, so you never see the icecubes.\n\nTo use the grapple, you need to bind something to usegrapple\ni.e. /bind mouse2 usegrapple\n**\n(Altrag notes: I've actually added this into defaults.cfg now. There's also a menu option in the Input tab if you wish to rebind the key that way).\n**\n\nMod file freezetag.zip (6.71 MB)\nRating\n57\npoints\n (7 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This is for the owner of the map to do.\nThe map has been checked for bugs and smoothed so that it looks clean when lit,\nbut geometry may be buggy if you edit with a small grid size.\"\n\nThis map is aimed mainly at beginners who want their map to look natural and realistic. One of the main problems I have when designing a map is how to 'fence it in' without making the player feel trapped.\nNovices can use this map as a base to create their own maps which they can then redistribute without needing to credit me.\n\nI did make some 12x12 and even a 14x14 maps, but these took 10 minutes to render lighting and I thought them impractical to use for the moment.\nThis map is mainly to test the water and see what you all think of the idea, but if it gets approval I'll set to work creating some more detailed and interesting maps and upload them as a pack.\n\nYou'll be downloading an .OGZ file only. It's up to you to create a config file and change the settings. This map is simply a base to build on.\nI've tried to keep a large amount of flat land to build on so that you're not forced into building into the hills. From my experience the height map tool can be very glitchy, but I've tried to smooth the geometry so that you don't get so many errors.\n\nI hope this isn't considered a waste of space. I try to make sure my work is worth downloading before I upload anything.\n\nAlso, just a shameless plug. *whistles*\nI'm currently working on a Silent-Hill based map, imaginatively called Sauer Hill which will be single player map. It'll be chock-full of new sounds effects, music and textures. So hopefully it'll be fairly engaging and interesting.\nIf anybody's interested, you can visit http://www.sauerhillproject.webs.com/\n\nAny support would be greatly appreciated. :)\n\n[EDIT]\nI've just finished a larger and slightly more interesting template map to make downloading the file more worthwhile. It takes 30 seconds to render on my computer so it shouldn't be too much trouble.\nThere are two maps, both geometrically identical, the only difference being that one has a river and the other is left as a dry ditch.\nHopefully this one should feel less claustrophobic and more natural.\n\nMap file basemaps.zip (621.85 KB)\nRating\n96\npoints\n (15 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

The map has also been redone for UT2004 called \"DM-Campgrounds\". My goal was not to do an 1:1 remake and I tried to find an own style to do things. Also I wanted to get familiar to the Cube-Editor so this is not a real masterpiece of work. At least I hope that i got little experience and learned some lessons for a next map if there will be one.\n\nI'm kind a fan of this map, so I did a short video to compare UT2004, Q3 and my version.\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/1939460\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7VQamA3ndc\n\nThats it.

Updated: Slight layout modification, improoved look.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (456KB)\nDetailed description\n\nGeneral presentation V2 (improoved too ^^)\n\nThis map was build not to be an other face to face CTF, althought it's symetric for the sake of balance. So I gave it a L shape, with a lot of vertical gameplay. Even there was not an absolute need, I gave each side of the map a color theme: green and blue. Depending of my mood, I used to prefer one side or one other, that's a strange feeling, so I believe overall it's OK. It doesn't camouflage your oponents (wich are red or yellow, and may be difficult to see when the map is red or yellow), and it balances with the red shades of the skyboxes and the skylight I chose.\n\nUpdate 3 : I changed the layout slightly, remove useless details here and there, add some details here and there. I believe the overrall look of the map has improoved.\n\nUpdate 2: (Better flow, better CTF, now with capture).\n\nA major flaw with the flow need to be corrected, and it lead to the rebuild of a part of the map. Now I believe the gameplay to be really good in CTF, especially insta. I also modified other little things, like putting clip where _I_ wouldn't need it but where non-bunny-hoping player may have feel unconfortable without.\nBecause of the rebuild, the map felt like it was OK for capture now, then I placed capture bases in a non-symetric way; it lets me use every interesting part (for a base) only once, so it shouldn't feel redundant despite the map is symetric. Ammo is random, because I believe it had a lot of replayability and force players to change their tactics (yeah, there are tactics in SB, sure! :) ) according to which ammo is where (especially in regen capture).\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nLights fixed, Item placement fixed, flow fixed, and playerstarts placed.\n\nMap file l_ctf_udated.zip (1.09 MB)\nRating\n102\npoints\n (14 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

New commands, a new voting system and new gametypes have been implemented. There are a number of new maps and new models to play on and play with. The network protocol has gotten a big overhaul - it now uses more server-side logic to combat a number of cheats seen in the older versions and records demos server-side too; with the new spectator mode this allows for a detailed analysis of games in retrospect and is definitely a furthering of the fun factors of the game.\nIf you want to see how much fun can be put into 40 MB - just check out the official website or go to the release download page directly.",

The downloaded blacklists are the latest BL files, and are taken from the most popular servers. The last blacklist file you used is saved as backup_serverblacklist.cfg in the same directory, but be careful: if you launch BLU one time, it will make a backup, but if you run it again, the last backup would be overwritten ! So if you want to make regular backups to see the blacklist changing, you will have to rename each backup before updating.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n- Copy BlackList Updater and config.cfg in your AC directory.\n- Run this application in a shell, with the command './BlackListUpdater'.\n- Press enter, and let the application work.\n\nWhat blacklists are dowloaded to my hard drive ?\n\nThe actual config files let the application download the blacklists files from the TyD and the BC servers.

This is useful if you are making a map and something goes wrong, leaving you without a recent save.\n\nTo use it bind toggleAutosave to a key of your choosing\nFor example: /bind P toggleAutosave\n\nYou can also set the amount of time between saves. Do this by setting the variable saveinterval.\nFor example (again): /saveinterval = 10\nThat would set it to save every 10 minutes.\n\nThe last option is the autosavemapname option.

It is trained to perform\nhigh-risk operations that fall outside of the abilities\nof regular patrol officers, including serving high-risk\narrest warrants, barricaded suspects, hostage rescue,\ncounter-terrorism, and engaging heavily-armed criminals.\nSWAT teams are often equipped with specialized firearms\nincluding assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns,\ncarbines, riot control agents, stun grenades, and high-powered\nrifles for snipers. They have specialized equipment\nincluding heavy body armor, entry tools, armored vehicles,\nadvanced night vision optics, and motion detectors for\ncovertly determining the positions of hostages or hostage\ntakers inside of an enclosed structure.\nThe first SWAT team was established in the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment in the 1960s. Since then,\nmany American police departments, especially in major cities\nand at the federal and state-levels of\ngovernment, have established their own elite units under\nvarious names; these units, despite their official\nname, are referred to collectively as SWAT units in colloquial usage.\n\nsource: wikipedia,\nmore about s.w.a.t on wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMod file s.w.a.t.zip (173.67 KB)\nURL http://www.acka.biz\nRating\n42\npoints\n (8 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

It´s called 'fabrik' which is the german word for 'factory'.\n\nTHE SCENARIO:\n\nSince the contest`s theme is street/city I decided to make an industrial part of a town. Imagine there are two factories producing the same product and now each wants to get rid of his business rival...\n\nTHE FACTS:\n\nThe major layout is window shaped. Have a look at the ms windows icon and you may understand. ;) This way it´s quite symmetrical. The whole map is mirrored along the diagonal axis, despite some little differences, which should give equal conditions to both sites. The street is pretty open, of course, but there are entrances, gaps between buildings and crates to run for cover.\n\nRefering to the maps layout I recommend playing it on CTF and TOSOK.\n\nENJOY!\n\nMap file ac_fabrik_1.1.zip (22.8 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This is our newest map, made for FFA and Instagib Deathmatches. One side of the map was supposed to be the first part of a singleplayer map i started months ago, so it's quite narrow compared to other maps. But we figured out, that it gives the map a very special gameplay!\n\nSo mainly, we didn't add any rockets, because we thought that it would make the gameplay in FFA very annoying. That's also the reason, why we don't advise you to play efficiency on this map ;)\n\nWe didnt add any Quad and YellowArmour either, so noone can be really dominating the game. In the End, the map provided a very fast and interesting gameplay, for both FFA (where the grenades seems to be one of the most powerful weapons) and Instagib (where the fist is an important element with 3 or more players)\nWe already had the chance to play a few test games with 2-4 players, and we were pretty happy with the result. If you have any suggestions how to improve the map, post a comment, we're open for review! :)\n\nThanks to Misan, who had the idea of turning it into a Deathmatch map and helped me enlarge the part that was already there, and to Suicizer, who helped us finding some mistakes in the map.\n\nMap file sandstorm.zip (603.26 KB)\nRating\n108\npoints\n (13 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

YAY!\n\nIt's called Station because the first thing I made was a check-in building for cars and trucks, and then I built the rest around it. I was trying to make a part of a city, that had become a warzone for two warring sides, and I think I did a good job.\n\nThe map is fairly large, and is set at night, but it shouldn't be a problem with the lights I put in. It features 5 buildings. An old, run-down building with water infestation with windows for sniping, the check-in building with a window for sniping, a nightclub with a dance floor, bar, tv's and cover, a small office building with a window for sniping, and a warehouse for some extended cover. There's also a small waterway.\n\nThe map has flags for CTF, CLA having the warehouse for a base, and RSVF having the nightclub as a base. Also has spawn locations for FFA so you can play OSOK and all that good stuff.\n\nThe streets are filled with objects for cover. Crates and roadblocks hide you in tight spots, and fences block the way of gung-ho soldiers. I think this map is my best so far, so please download and enjoy!\n\nEDIT: New upload. I accidently made a spawn point in an area you couldn't get out of.

It's under 2000 to be exact.\n\nThis map is actually called Medieval Chamber, because that's what it is. It's set high on a rocky mountain top in the ocean. It used to hold prisoners way back when... now this chamber has become killing grounds.\n\nI finally figured out the arches and slopes to a degree, so I used them a little bit in this map. No lights this time, because I would like this to become a AC release. :)\n\nThe weapon and health pickups are fairly balanced. Also, being a REALLY small map, I can only suggest playing DM or CTF on it. OSOK would be relatively pointless. Last Swiss Standing is great for this map, along with Pistol Frenzy.\n\nThe map itself is very detailed. Scattered shells fill the floor, along with cigarettes, opened ammo boxes with shells spilled around them, falling debris, and damaged floors, walls, and pillars. The RSVF and CLA's equipment make the scene a little more modern, with communication racks and servers installed in their respective bases while keeping the old look as well.\n\nThis is my third map in the course of 3 days. Please download, comment and enjoy. :)\n\nEDIT: The screenshots are misleading hehe. I didn't add lights, which means the map is all dark... learn something new everyday. I thought desert had some sort of fullbright option on to make it look so bright, but I saw it was just lights.\n\nAnyway, updated the links with the fixed map.\n\nMap file ac_chamber by R4L fixed.zip (10.49 KB)\nURL http://www.2dadventure.com/ags/ac_chamber_by_R4L_fixed.zip\nRating\n24\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This is were I came in, my good offered me a spot and I accepted his offer to help with this idea that was bouncing around in his head. Before I was fully accepted into the project, the layout was 70% done.\nAfter we got to working on all the major entities we realized that the WHOLE map needed to be retextured (-_- fortunently this was very easy thanks to Myself copy and pasting all the textures while killer worked on other parts of the layout) Soon after I finished the lights, textures and other small details, we got to work on the cfg, adding things here and there and disagreeing on things, but we managed to pull threw and finish the main part of the cfg.\nBy this time 80%-85% of JUST the layout had been finished (That last few percent was a bunch of knick-knacks added in at the very end)\nKiller began to realize that Emereald was just not cutting it, there had to be some way to get a better skybox. one day while browsing Quake 3 mods by ..::LVL he cam across a skybox package (with over 50 skyboxes) These skyboxes were free to use for non-comercial purposes, as long as the artist's name was provided. As soon as the .TGA's were converted into .JPG's he tested out 6 skyboxes. Killer decided that \"Green\" was the best. (in the midst of all this Killer and I decided to make a custom texture for the map)\nThe map was finally looking up to the standards of Cube 2's moderators and developers. Killer and I added the final touches such as; health, weapons, armour, and particles. One of the most annoying things to do was the particles.\nThe map was finally finnished.. or was it? I fixed a few things in the cfg (Generatde PVS /genpvs) and packaged the files\nMy final job was to write exactly what your reading now. Enjoy this wonderful map by KI113R and Redon not only by playing death match's and capturing bases, but by taking your spare time to look at the beautiful geometry that was slaved to render.\n\nTotal time was about 20 hours (not including ideas thought up at night during our sleep)\nEnjoy The Frags on this beautiful map,\nKI113R and Redon\"\n\n(epic description written in my point of view by: KI113R)\n\nHere are other maps I built or helped on, you should check them out and leave a comment :)\n\n\nMap file killcore3.zip (7.13 MB)\nRating\n134\npoints\n (18 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Hopefully the last? Let me know if I missed anything.\n\nThe map is currently saved as \"memento2b\" to avoid conflicts with the current release version. Please try to playtest the map with friends and give me feedback on the changes, any further suggestions are welcome.\n\n2015 January - Update 2B:\n- Fixed the gap behind the jumppad that was out of range\n- New lighting with more skylight, so the shadows from the sun aren't as dominant anymore\n- Added a fogdome and changed fogcolour to a brighter and warmer color that transitions into the greenish tint of the skybox\n- Added mapsounds that were missing in the last update\n- The map now loads all its textures from the cfg, which allowed me to change some texture settings more easily.\n- Fixed a few minor texture errors while retexturing the map\n- Added blendmaps to the mountains and caves\n- Added the two grass patches back in, but with a dry, brown color.\n- Added an arch and brick texture from Gregor Koch's set which were used to make the gates in the cave a bit prettier.\n- The grates near the cave were replaced with something similar, but still let grenades pass through.\n- The section below the biggest house was also changed using the new arch texture.\n- More detail on the window frames and blinds, as well as on the pillars and roofs of the three cover pieces\n- The shape of the roof of each cover piece has been changed slightly to bend downwards at the sides. This should make it easier to hit the surface with rockets from the side so they provide less of an advantage.\n- Some minor clipping improvements\n- Added more playerstarts (from 13 to 20)\n- Removed two health pickups, one at each greenarmour (from 7 to 5)\n- Changed position of the three ammo packs below the upper greenarmour\n- Moved the very helpful cartridges to the roofs of the cover pieces\n- Added three bases for tiny capture or hold games\n\n2014 December - Update 2A:\n- Moved teledest back into its original corner, and green armour back down\n- Changed the HB roof into a balcony with railing\n- Reduced size of top platform with rockets\n- Changes to ammo placement\n- Added more spawnpoints\n- A few more boxes are back in the center\n- Improved clipping\n- I honestly don't even remember\n- Other minor things\n\n2014 November - Update 2:\n- Lowered floor in the upper area to allow easy jumping from the right platform to the left, as well as a roof not in the picture.\n- Moved teledest in the upper area from the left to the other end seen in the picture above the boxes.\n- Moved upper area green armour to where the teledest was.\n- Removed most of the boxes that cluttered the central lower area, to provide easier movement, and placed a platform that replaces all their functions.\n- Changed the layout of this area and reduced the size of the cover so you don't hit your head on it anymore.\n- All cover pieces are now the same size. The two in the lower area received a tiny free strip before the drop to make jumping around them easier. (see image above)\n- Prettier hills.\n- Prettier caves!\n- Moved health boost to a new location.\n- Expanded this area and added a way around to the rockets instead of the old box jump up a narrow platform. Jumping against the box also no longer makes you drop all the way down to the stairs.\n- You can now easily shoot grenades through the iron bars near the caves.\n- Adjusted jump-pad strength\n- Did I mention that the jumppad is prettier too?\n\nOld\n\nUPDATE 1: I fixed a few things, like the flames that were going through the roof, clipped the water parts in the cave and removed the grass.\n\nThis is a small deathmatch map that i made today in a few hours, which is pretty unusual for me, since it normally takes ages until I finish a map. I hope this isn't noticeable in the quality of the map. On this map, i mainly focused on the gameplay, since my maps usually just look good but don't have a too great gameplay, in my opinion.\nI tried to give the map a good flow so that you dont get stuck often, and I hope I managed to do that.\n\nPlease download, rate, and comment!\n\nMap file memento_update_2b.zip (1.35 MB)\nRating\n155\npoints\n (19 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Anyway, the singleplayer map took me months, so I'm pretty happy that this one is done. :)\n\nThe map is kinda formed like an \"U\", with the flags at the ends and jumppads in the middle.\n\nPlease download, rate and comment it! :)\n\nThis map is called recovery, because the matches on it actually take place after your adventure on the earlier mentioned singleplayer map, as the base gets recovered after your escape.\n\nUPDATE 1: Enlarged the middle room because it was too narrow, changed the ground to make it less bumpy, added two little forts at both sides.\nUPDATE 2: Enlarged the entrance to the middle room, enlarged the entrance to the towers, added waypoints, added pvs, added some lasers to indicate that the hole is deadly, replaced the quad damage with a healthboost.\nFINAL UPDATE: Made the jumppads to yellow armour more obvious, added some bridges between the towers that bring more cover from snipers at the top and a lot of new trickjumps. Fixed the lightcolor in the room under the red side\n\nHere are other maps I built or helped on, you should check them out and leave a comment :)\n\n\nMap file recovery.zip (2.3 MB)\nRating\n110\npoints\n (13 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

However, I expect some smaller fixes to follow soon. There's a big chance I missed something somewhere.\n\nThe map is currently saved as \"frozen6a\" to avoid conflicts with the current release version. Please try to playtest the map with friends and give me feedback on the changes, any further suggestions are welcome.\n\nThanks to Frosty for spending a lot of time on the map, helping me with good ideas, and lastly for his contribution in the cave (:\nA big thanks also to swatllama, Fatality, starch and everyone else who helped out with feedback while I was working on the map.\n\n2015 January - Update 6A:\n\n- The lighting on the map has been completely redone. The light of the lamps shifted towards a more orange color.\n- Changed skybox to meister/uzze\n- Added more fog and a fogdome\n- More skylight, less sunlight: The sharp shadows are gone and instead the map has a cloudier, gloomier atmosphere.\n- Added snowflakes\n- Added mapsounds and sound effect for jumppad.\n\n- Added slippery ice (thanks to Frosty)\n- Changed the hue and opacity of the ice texture and removed the specmaps from the snow texture.\n- Cleaned up the texture cfg to remove duplicates\n- The shabby old mountains have been replaced and new sections have been added\n- The mountains use two new rock textures from the terrain_soc set\n- Blendmapping has been renewed and some were added to the snow and metal floor\n\n- The platform near the yellowarmour and the surrounding area has been redesigned to make movement easier\n- The section around the bigger staircase has been created from scratch because the old version was very lazy\n- The point where the staircase disappears into the ice has been done from scratch without the snow in the way. Looks a lot nicer this way.\n- Countless other improvements to geometry and texturing to make the map look a little prettier. Like this.\n\n- The healthboost and greenarmour have switched places: More cover for the GA, more risk for the HB down on the ice.\n- Reduced number of health pickups from 6 to 4.\n- Added two additional ammopacks: shells and grenades.\n- Some shells and grenades have switched places.\n- One of the bullets packs near the jumppad was removed. Bullets near the lower teledest were moved down to the ice.\n- Added a lot of playerstarts and adjusted existing ones (from 8 to 27)\n- Cleaned up clipping after all the changes\n\n- Of course I forgot to mention the wider corridor near the YA. Arguably one of the most important changes.\n\nOld\n\nAfter memento, this is another small deathmatch map for which I focused on the flow of gameplay, this time with a snowy theme. Again, the map didnt take too long, but a bit longer than memento. I started it 2 days ago, and now it's done with waypoints. I'd like to hear what you think about it, and if you have any suggestions for improvements, write a comment :)\n\n2012 January - UPDATE 5:\n- Most importantly: The water pits have been removed. The entire area is now covered with snow and ice, providing the map with a central area for fighting, without getting stuck in the holes.\n- Increased width of two hallways, giving the players more space\n- Changed the double jumppad gap to a continous path, with a platform on the side to climb up\n- Moved teledest to greenarmour spot\n- Added healthboost at old teledest location\n- Moved greenarmour to new location\n- Added stairs in front of yellowarmour for people with walking disabilities\n- Added some details in the lower area\n\nThanks to Suicizer and Misan for the help!\n\nUPDATE 4: Clipped/Noclipped a few things, changed Screenshot and Mapimage\nUPDATE 3: Changed the snow texture, Changed Jumppad Texture\nUPDATE 2: Fixed a clipping error and removed the pistol ammo\nUPDATE: Removed Deathclip in the Water, removed some snow, changed jumppad texture and improved the ice texture\n\n\nMap file frozen_update_6a.zip (1.58 MB)\nRating\n170\npoints\n (20 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I wanted something indoor that required a little more thinking and strategy to play. The map is mirrored and has distinctive themes on both sides (so you always know where you are). It has 3 interlinked floors and supports CTF/Protect and Capture.\n\nCTF/Protect: there's a flag on each side of the map. Ample room to run around in protect, if you are the flag bearer, there is enough cover to require some serious thinking and good strategy from your opponents if they want to force you in a corner and get your flag.\n\nCapture: 10 bases disposed in an \"eye\" shape. Designed for big games (12+ players), should be perfect for those big 20+ players public servers.\n\nThe map requires some learning to master, a few games will be required to know it by heart.

So that's why i put much work into the cfg as well, it's over 1000 lines and doesn't have many texture settings, most of the textures settings are in a separate file.\n\nThanks to PhilipK and Metlslime for the great textures i used on my map, to Younes for translating the whole campaign into french, and to the people who helped me with ideas, especually MisanthropX.\n\nUPDATE 1: I fixed/changed a few things in the scripts and changed the ammo placement a bit, since it had too much ammo now in my opinion.\nUPDATE 2: There's now a french Translation of the campaign avalible as an attachment, tranlated by Younes. Thank you very much!\n\nNote: The French Translation requires the original map pack to play, just replace the default file \"lost.cfg\" with the translated one.\n\nHere are other maps I built or helped on, you should check them out and leave a comment :)\n\n\nMap file lost.zip (3.8 MB)\nRating\n275\npoints\n (31 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nFrench Translation.zip\t8.8 KB\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Blurb Sauerbraten procedural planet demo (not fully functional yet)\nScreenshot \nGet original file (156KB)\nDetailed description\n\nSauer-planet v0.001 - demo of procedural planets in Sauerbraten\n\n# INTRO\n# PACKAGE CONTENTS\n# PHOTO GALLERY\n# USAGE\n# CULPRITS / NOTES\n# DETAILS\n# COMPILING W/ CODEBLOCKS + MINGW UNDER WINDOWS\n# WHY??\n\n# INTRO\n\nThis package is a, not fully working, demonstration of procedural planets in the open-source engine Sauerbraten (http://www.sauerbraten.org/). It is based on CTF Edition (June 17, 2008) for Windows (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sauerbraten/sauerbraten_2008_06_20_ctf_edition_win32_setup.exe), and includes sources, patch files and a Windows executable (a Sauerbraten installation is required to run the executable).\n\nThe procedural code is taken almost verbatim from GPL'd code by Sean O'Neil from:\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20061104133933/http://www.sponeil.org/Sandbox-src.zip Sandbox Source Code]\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20061104133933/http://www.sponeil.org/Sandbox-exe.zip Sandbox Executables]\n\ndescribed in a series of articles on Gamasutra.com, \"A real time procedural universe\":\n\n** [http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20010302/oneil_01.htm \"A Real-Time Procedural Universe, Part 1: Generating Planetary Bodies\"]\n** [http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20010810/oneil_01.htm Gamasutra - Features - \"A Real-Time Procedural Universe, Part Two: Rendering Planetary Bodies\"]\n** [http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20020712/oneil_01.htm Gamasutra - Features - \"A Real-Time Procedural Universe, Part Three: Matters of Scale\"]\n** [http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060112/oneil_01.shtml Gamasutra - Feature - \"A Real-Time Procedural Universe, Part Four: Dynamic Ground Textures and Objects\"]\n\n# PACKAGE CONTENTS\n\nThe contents have the same layout as the directory structure for Sauerbraten on Windows - you can just copy the package contents (all dependencies should be there too) over to a Sauerbraten installation folder, and run sauerbraten_planet-mingw.bat to start the executable. The executable is compiled with Mingw using Codeblocks.\n\nAlso, source code and a Codeblocks workspace project is provided - copying over should also replace the necessary files in Sauerbraten's source directory. There are also diff .patch files, both in respect to Sauerbraten CTF Edition (June 17, 2008) source, and in respect to Sandbox procedural planet code.\n\n# PHOTO GALLERY\n\nhttp://img141.imageshack.us/gal.php?g=12sauerplanet07.png\n\nhttp://img141.imageshack.us/my.php?image=12sauerplanet07.png\n\n# USAGE\n\nsauerbraten_planet-mingw.bat automatically starts a map called untitled (provided in packages/base), which is an empty map, in fps (first person shooter) mode of Sauerbraten. Once in it:\n* Press E to activate edit mode\n* (Alt: use /togpshade - see below)\n* Choose a tile on the floor and type /newent planet 1\n* Press E to exit edit mde\n* Press E to enter edit mode again\n* After a slight delay (and a noticeable framerate drop) the planets should start rendering.\nThen, look for two small dots overlaid on the screen, and fly towards them. You should eventually arrive to two spherical renderings like on:\nhttp://img141.imageshack.us/my.php?image=09sauerplanet05.png\n\nAdditional to the new entity type 'planet', there are some added commands for the in-game console:\n/togpshade N\n(N can be 0, 1, 2) - toggle different shading of planet atmosphere (hardware shader, software shader, software scatter shader) - see below\n/moveme X Y Z\nA command like /moveme 100 100 100 will try to take you to x=100, y=100, z=100 position in the game world, by tossing you there with high speed, in an attempt to overcome the physics engine :) It doesn't take you exactly to the required location, but close enough. (Current position of player is also rendered in the console).\n\n# CULPRITS / NOTES\n\n- There is no interaction whatsoever with the planet renderings.\n- A serious crash of the GPU (at least on ATI Mobility Radeon) is caused by src\\engine\\planet/Planet_Quad/PlanetaryMapNode.cpp line 674: m_boVertex.Enable(&m_shape); unfortunately, it seems this step is required in order to properly render planet surfaces. So ...\n- ... There is a bug with the graphics, so the planet surfaces, although calculated, are not rendered. Only planet atmospheres are rendered on screen.\n- There is a bug with the planet atmospheres blending, so they are represented as a dense wireframe.\n- Using the /togpshade command while planets are rendered can result with a crash; use before planets are placed.\n\n# DETAILS\n\nBy executing the command\n\n/newent planet N\n\nin edit mode, and activating the planet entity (by exiting then enteirng edit mode), will read the text file named \"N.conf\" in packages/planet. So, '/newent planet 1' will read the provided packages/planet/1.conf file, which is a near copy of Planet_Quad.conf (from Sandbox sources). Each .conf file can contains information about multiple planets, and properties for each of them (such as noise map specifications). Note that rendered planets will not be placed in respect to the entity placeholder - but instead at the absolute coordinates specified in the .conf file.\n\nIn the Sandbox sources:\n- the Planet_Quad project shows procedural surface generation based on a .conf file and uses a hardware shader for the atmosphere. Note that the code in this package was produced using a graphics card without support for hardware shaders, so the atmosphere is rendered as wireframe:\n\nhttp://img139.imageshack.us/my.php?image=01planetquad01.png\nhttp://img136.imageshack.us/my.php?image=02planetquad02.png\n\n- The ScatterCPU project shows a software atmosphere scattering shader, which on the same graphics card is rendered like this:\n\nhttp://img91.imageshack.us/my.php?image=03scattercpu01.png\nhttp://img78.imageshack.us/my.php?image=04scattercpu02.png\n\nThis demo package includes the code for both the hardware renderer and software scattering renderer (although due to the above blending bug, the software scattering renderer is also rendered as wireframe in this demo), which can be toggled using:\n\n/togpshade N\n\nwhere N can be:\n- 0 (hardware), http://img141.imageshack.us/my.php?image=09sauerplanet05.png (38-41 fps)**\n- 1 (software - simple),\n- 2 (software scattering). http://img136.imageshack.us/my.php?image=11sauerplanet07b.png (8-10 fps)\n\n** Note that 38-41 fps was obtained before any software rendering code was present at all - after the software rendering and the toggle, framerate drops to about 19 fps, regardless of the rendering method used. In both cases, a debug MingW executable under Win XP was used; initially at empty map, before planets are placed, it displays about 120 fps. You can also try editing the 1.conf file, and setting one of the planets to be 'big' - say at (1000,1000,1000), with a radius of 500 - in this case, speed can drop to 9 fps.\n\nFrom a Sauerbraten perspective, the planet class is a \"dynamic entity\" just as monsters (the planet.h file is based on monster.h) - this is so to allow for a possility to place and save \"planets\" in a map, using the map edit facilities of Sauerbraten - and the possibility to become a part of the physics engine. From the perspective of Sandbox procedural planet sources, it implements code in the Planet_Quad and ScatterCPU projects.\n\n# COMPILING W/ CODEBLOCKS + MINGW UNDER WINDOWS\n\nYou can use the provided CodeBlocks workspace (and project) file. Maybe not trivial (CodeBlocks 8.02), see:\n#11565: Menus not Building Correctly?\nhttp://cubeengine.com/forum.php4?action=display_thread&thread_id=1&start=11558\n\nSo needs\nTDM-MinGW / TDM-GCC\n(exe that can be unpacked with PeaZip):\nhttp://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=200665&filename=tdm-mingw-1.902.0-f1.exe&a=36511655\n\nAnd also:\nhttp://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/binutils-2.19.1-mingw32-bin.tar.gz\nhttp://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/mingw-utils-0.3.tar.gz\nhttp://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnuwin32/libpng-1.2.35-lib.zip\nhttp://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/glew/glew-1.5.1-win32.zip (must build from source)\nhttp://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.13-mingw32.tar.gz\nif there are problems..\n\n# WHY??\n\nI recently got to know Sauerbraten, and I found it to be most playable and smooth open source engine.. On the other hand, I'm fond of FPS, but not too much - I like a bit of adventure thrown in :) That is why I liked Freelancer - because it allowed the \"seamless descent\" from space to a planet, and had most of the \"go shoot, go sell, go buy\" mechanics..\n\nSo eventually, I'd love an open-source, single-player, open-ended game that would allow me to:\n\n1. Start on surface\n2. Shoot some monsters\n3. Get into a ship and launch to space\n4. Go mine resources (or shoot ships)\n5. Descent on surface\n6. Shoot some monsters\n7. Possibly go in a portal loading an FPS map; finishing or exiting it takes you back to planet surface\n8. Go to NPC, sell booty, buy ammo\n9. Go back to 1 :)\n\nAnd Sauerbraten actually provides most of this for me - except for the planets. So although I have very basic knowledge of C++ and OpenGL, when I saw how 'compatible' the sources for the Sandbox procedural planets and rest of Sauerbraten looked, it became almost an obsession to try and integrate them - at least as a proof of concept :)\n\nAs both Sauerbraten and the procedural Sandbox code are open-source, my particular work in their integration is also under the same terms and conditions.\n\n:)n 2009\n\nMod file Sauer-planet.zip (2.43 MB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Since I'm no modeller at all, and have no modelling skills whatsoever, a visor instead of the snout's face was the easiest thing to do, and so I did.\n\nEventually, I began using it as my snoutx10k player replacement, and tweaked the skin and config around to make it stand out more for each team's side (as I had some troubles myself with differentiating between red and blue players before with the original snoutx10k, which -as it turns out- is partly due to the 'morning' skybox used as a reflection map). I'm pretty satisfied with how things turned out.\n\nDepicted on the picture is a comparison between visor and snoutx10k. Note that these don't have the 'brightening of player models' enabled, as they're all mapmodels. So in-game, if you have the brightening enabled, they stand out just a bit more... For those curious to what I changed: I tweaked the helmet, the torso (made it less fat), and the arms.\n\nAlso note that the download size is 17.9MB, and that this is more-or-less DELIBERATELY packaged wrong, as you might want to BACKUP YOUR EXISTING SNOUTX10K FOLDER in case you want to revert back to the original Snoutx10k.\n\nURL http://mooses.nl/sauer/visor/visor-a2.zip\nRating\n95\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I didn't see a single error as far as textures or geometry go. Map is up for review now and I hope to get some good feedback on it.\n\nThe design is MUCH closer to Corruption, one of my prouder maps.

This update is the biggest yet and hopefully the last as movement has been improved as well as the look of the map.\n\nFinal update I think. A good bit of lighting additions. That is about it really.\n\nGuess that wasn't the final update. Ever so slight geometry changes and 'support' for CTF\nAdded just a bit more room to play. Mostly to give a few better paths to get to the upper flag. I found out that even playing against bots it was WAY too easy to protect compared with the other. Screenshot and waypoints also updated for new changes.\nFinal changes (I hope.) New skybox, new texture changes. Some geometry modification.

The textures from Infinity and 2 were taken from Tim Vogel's TTEP 6.0 which is freely available here: http://orbitalarm.bungie.org/downloads/textures.html\n(TTEP 7 can be found here: http://www.simplici7y.com/items?search=ttep)\n\nThe textures from Rubicon can be found with the rest of the game here: http://www.marathonrubicon.com/\n\nTo install, drop the \"mtk\" folder into your sauerbraten packages folder. While in the game, run one of the cfg files (ex.: \"exec packages/mtk/infinity_hi_water.cfg\"). Note: If you run load_all_textures.cfg with all the default textures, your texture browser will tweak out. I tried to find the cfg for that menu but failed...\n\nIf you actually use these textures in a map, I strongly recommend making your own cfg file that points to the actual textures instead of the cfg files included. I say you should do this because this package is far from complete and I'll probably end up changing the cfgs sometime in the future.\n\nIn the future, you should expect these additions:\nMarathon 1 textures\nTempus Irae textures\nTTEP 7.0 textures (I have to convert them all from dds and resize them to get them to work)\nOriginal 128x128 textures from the original games, not the remade textures (I like the originals WAY better)\nTextures from other mods, possibly Marathon RED?\ncfgs that have working glowmaps/animated textures\n\nWhat is this \"Marathon\" game I speak of? It's what Bungie did many years before their famous Halo title. You can get a free, open source version here: http://source.bungie.org/get/\n\nApparantly the PHP uploader craps out after 10.5 mb.

Unfortunatelly I can't remember his name.\n\nHowever, the map was almost playable when we had to quit the session, but of course poorly detailed and the RVSF base really looked like rushed together... Even though I thought this map is not outstanding or special at all, I liked the fairly simple, small layout and started to work up the entire RVSF area. Finally it looked like it was worth spending some more time on it and so I added details, adjusted models, put the scene into a snowy white and so on.\n\nI already had some test games last night and the map turned out to be too dark. Well, I have to admit that my laptop screen is quite bright and so I gained the map's brightness to a point, I just can guess might be appropriate. I would be thankful if you keep an eye especially on the lighting and give some feedback. Thanks.\n\nThe absolute maximum of players for this map should be 10 by all means. An amount of 8 players already feels crowded, in my opinion. There are flags in this map, but flag modes don't work that good really.

It's something we just can't live without. That's why at the end of this school year, it was a grand idea of mine to host the first ever Cube 2 Grand Prix - A QuakeCon-esque tourney with simple rules. Simple, that is, in theory...\n\nEveryone was given a computer, Cube 2, and a Singleplayer map to play through, which they had only 5 minutes to complete. Once they did, they were thrown onto a local server with eachother on a deathmatch map, and had to survive long enough to score three kills and qualify. And that was only day one...\n\nOn the second day, a concern arose - We had an avid camper in our midst, who had completely dominated the first day's proceedings. I couldn't allow this to go on. Overnight, I crafted an interesting solution, a map where all spawn points are in plain view of eachother, and there is absolutely nowhere to hide, and so it was: Frag Box.\n\nIn that round, all of the players were put tier-style against eachother in a four-way free-for-all, the one with the best score moving on to the next round, and let me tell you, most were completely dumbstruck by how such a simple, tiny little map could actually be so much hectic fun!\n\nSafe to say, all those who attempted to camp perished.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nFirst release to Quadropolis! Please provide feedback and help me balance this map further!\n\nAdditionally, about the diary and candle on the roof... They're in memory of a student we had lost during the year. Sauer was one of his favorite games, so this whole tourney was partly to pay tribute to such a brilliant mind gone by...\n\nMap file c2gp_fragbox.zip (295.93 KB)\nRating\n14\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Realizing that a great deal of the textures in Sauer were from quake mods, I figured that an expanded set might be available, so I tracked down the original author, discovered that the texture set is being distributed in a more complete form then what was in Sauer, and set about repackaging the latest set from the author. Because of my addiction to this set, my package.cfg has alot of redundancy with rotated, pulsing, and env-reflective variations so I could achieve the designed effects in my maps- Given that you have to call this package explicitly anyways, I figured it was better to have too many variations than too few.\n\nI *did not* create these textures, they are the work of Philipk (www.philipk.net)\n\nIncludes:\n-159 textures (!)\n-package.cfg file to load 112 materials, many just the common rotations I'd use for my maps\n-Complete mapping on many of the surfaces which lacked them\n-Most textures are twice the resolution they were previously, not sure if the old package used older versions or what\n-Several lights from Philipk's older collection, included for lack of large light source options in set\n-Every texture EXCEPT the aforementioned light additions is atleast bumpspecmap, some using bumpspecmapglow\n-Depth-mapped trim\n-Computer panels with pulse variations (Great effect, if you have never used it)\n-Matte/Reflective blending on tiles, brilliant visuals (Really, try this!)\n-All texture in-game scales match the older set, so converting is simple\n-All trim has atleast two variations, atleast one without glow. (Actual color variations, not simply removing the glow)\n-Nine new surfaces that were not present in the current Sauer set (Aswell as variations on many more)\n\nIf anyone is interested I may make a replacement mod for the default set, replacing it with the full resolution assets.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Edit1: Removed hidden Mac files, my apologies for letting those sneak in.\n\nMod file pk.zip (5.43 MB)\nRating\n65\npoints\n (7 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Completely re-textured the inside of the building, made some areas bigger, added a vent from the elevator to a hall so it's not a dead end, fixed the snow drifts since the slopes didn't make much sense, replaced the pickups so that everything isn't in the bases, completely new lighting. Thanks to Mr. Floppy for the advice!\n\nAlso, had to re-up the map. Left some textures undone and cleared some more crap up for more space and less lag. Enjoy!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wanted to go off and do a map which I think hasn't been thought of yet.\n\nThis here is an oil rig, in the middle of the Arctic! The name Spec-Ops comes from my imagining of RVSF being the ones infiltrating while CLA is in charge of the oil rig.\n\nThe map doesn't take place near any oil, but instead, the more \"corporate\" parts of the rig, like the security floor. I figured if I added water, it would add to lag, despite being absolutely awesome having black water simulating oil. Plus, that would just make gameplay frustrating when you're wading through blackness...\n\nI've added many passages, and also a whole helipad and elevator, which is broken by the way. :)\n\nThe map is suitable for DM, OSOK, and CTF, although it's a bit small in some corridors. Also, want to mention that I have not added any ambient sounds, simply because I do not understand how the settings work yet. Some of my maps had them, and all the settings for each sound are random because I'm still working out how they work.\n\nThis map has taken me 24 hours of work, nonstop. I mean it! It's 7:00 A.M now here and I'm sore from sitting here and tired as all hell. So please, rate and comment.

I don't think it should do too much harm, though.\n\n* Changed position of pick-ups. Reduced Grenade Launcher count to one. Pistol rounds are gone. You won't last very long with a Pistol, anyway, so I justify it with that.\n\n* Added two new methods of movement. The first is the teleporters at the bottom level, completing the whole bottom-middle-top thing, so that all levels can get to every other level in some fashion. Also, there is a giant ventilator shaft you can rifle-jump on top of, leaving you the rest of your rounds to snipe, at the very top level. The bots can't do this, though, so don't exploit it on them. Unless you want to. I would.\n\n* New map boxy, actually a picture of the map this time, although with post-processing Photoshop effects.

An vaguely Eastern architectural style was the goal. Comments are welcome!\n\n7/5/2009: Version 2 has been uploaded. Notable changes:\n-PVS culling is used, which has dramatically increased the framerate in many areas. However, the framerate is still kind of low in a few areas on some computers that I tested the map on. On my computer, turning down the water quality increased the fps from 29 to 55 in one area.\n-The quad damage and the health boost are both much more hidden and hard to get now.\n-The jump pads from the underground area to the surface have been replaced with stairways (except in the center of the map)\n-The lighting has been tweaked all over.\n-Small texture changes, including not having steel column bases.\nI kept the sniping areas, such as the roofs near the entrances to the garden, since I don't think campers would be safe there with the four towers in the vicinity.

I thought I'd go ahead and put them out here, seeing as how there's all these other people making skyboxes. I dont know what made this rush of people do this, but I hope you take the time to look at these. The Divine skybox is a sort of test of concept, as is the Wrath skybox. The Barren skybox was previously posted onto quad under another name. I decided to redo the camera position, and I deleted that node for some reason. Anyways, because I cannot map very well, I do skyboxes... Hope you enjoy these ones.

The indoor section of the map is set inside the base. Players have access to the outdoor section through a portal and hidden underground entrance. Rocky, uneven terrain - good for ambush and cover attacks. Indoor section has tight corridor setions and rooms which provide a good balance to the open outdoor sections.

They now are bumby, shiny and emit some shadows.\n\nHow to install :\n\nFirst backup your packages and especialy your packages.cfg files in an other directory. You should do this if you want to revert to the old textures.\nThen unzip/extract inside the sauerbraten directory -> overwrite all -> yes\n\nThere are many maps who benefit from my enhanced textures. If you play a map wich has dark textures, or looks strange, then it is required that you do a /calclight and save the map to keep the effect of my textures. Sadly there a number of maps that use their own texture config file, and I don't have the permission to distribute those here.\n\nIf you want too see all modified textures, then type the following when you start sauerbraten: /map texpreview\n\n***If anyone who has made a map, and fully supports my work, let me know, so I can supply an updated config file that uses the new textures. Altough newmade maps already support my textures, unless they supply a different one.\n\nUpdate V1.1 :\n\n- added \"glowcolour\" parameter to the lights\n- fine tuned height maps\n- fine tuned specular maps\n\nUpdate V1.1a :\n\n- fixed bug in ot ( small fix )\n- fixed missing texture ( thanks for kretren for alerting me )\n\nUpdate V1.2 :\n\n- Added tech1soc package\n\nBIG Update V1.7 :\n\n- Update now contains the dg, ikbase, ik2k, subverse, than_ind, g-pack, jf1 and payne texture packages, and some misc texture packages.\n- Tech1soc and egyptsoc are updated completely.\n- Some bugs are fixed.\n- First config file of the map \"tejen\" is now included. ( approved by mayhem )\n- A demo map for all the textures is now included. ( mainly for testing )\n- Removed unnecesairy files inside the zips to decrease file size.\n- Updated screenshot.\n\nUpdate V1.9 :\n\n- Complete remake of normals and redone some displacement maps where needed\n\nUpdate V1.9a :\n\n- Tiny fix of box texture that was to shiny.

    "content": "AssaultCube | Stable | Small (1-4) | Public Domain\nBlurb A small map featuring sparse lighting, a minimal layout, and adequate detailing.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (401KB)\nDetailed description\n\n[Update, August 28th] I've fixed some errors and added lighting for the driveway, so I'm uploading a new version that I will roughly title Release Candidate 2.\n\n::ABSTRACT::\nThis map depicts a quiet, yet functioning storage complex. The idea is that you are experiencing this facility after hours, hence the name \"nightshift.\"\n\n::STRUCTURE::\nThere are three little brick buildings, housing such things as gastanks and boxes. Additionally, two more fenced areas are designated for more crates, one of these also having a somewhat quarantined biohazard pool. All of these encircle the central office, while a vehicle gate indicates the complex's entrance.\n\n::GAMEPLAY::\nDue to the small size of the map (newmap 7) ac_nightshift is not recommended for teamplay. But the size is just right for a two- to four-person deathmatch or osok game. There are still individual team spawns, but there are no flag positions.\n\n::PROGRESS::\nI have no more immediate plans to modify this map, so I would dubb it as a release candidate; you are more than free to download and play it, but there is a slight chance I might make a revision or two.\n\n::COPYRIGHT::\nI haven't accquired any \"official\" licensing for ac_nightshift, so I have no choice but to release this to the public domain. But I did not use any custom content at all; these stock packages are licensed under their respective licenses. And of course, please don't mess with this map.\n\n::MAPPACK?::\nAssaultCube Devs: I heard this might be the best place to post a map if I'd like it in the map pack. I believe my map meets almost all the requirements to make it in; the WQD might be just a bit high in some places, but other than that I'm pretty confident that this map might qualify.\n\nMap file ac_nightshift.zip (175.69 KB)\nRating\n4\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

Hope you brought your swimming suit. ;D\n\nNote: Some of the rooms such as the Platform room you see in the screenshot above, have changed slightly since the image was made. Also, this map uses custom content, in the form of new ambient sounds (.ogg sound files). This is the reason for the larger than normal size of the .zip package.\n\nBackstory:\nA once busy oceanside shipyard has been taken over by CLA. The RVSF forces have received intelligence leading them to CLA, and chaos ensues upon their night time arrival.\n\nMode recommendation:\n- CTF, TDM, THTF, TKTF: up to 16 players\n- DM, OSOK, TOSOK: up to 10 players\n\nEntity statistics:\n- 220 lights\n- 54 playerstarts, 9 CLA, 8 RVSF, 37 FFA\n- 7 pistolclips\n- 7 ammoboxes\n- 4 grenades\n- 7 health\n- 2 armour\n- 1 akimbo\n- 337 mapmodels, 222 clipped\n- 5 ladders\n- 2 ctf-flags, 1 CLA, 1 RVSF\n- 46 sounds\n- 185 clips\n\nTotal: 877 Entities\n\nWe sincerely hope you all enjoy the map as much as we do!

It attempts to update the look of the original map and make it suitable for regular gameplay. I have correspond with Okicomputer a several times, obtaining his permission to release this map. He is working on completing the original map, and obviously his update will be more faithful to the original.\n\nMajor Changes:\n* New cfg file\n* Retexturing of entire map (with the same textures originally used)\n* New lighting that aims for a more natural and bright look\n* Update of map geometry to give the map a more open and airy appearance\n* Countless geometry bug fixes and small alternations that are almost unnoticeable\n* Update of map layout in an attempt to improve gameplay, especially for CTF and insta\n* New ent layout\n\nBasically I changed everything in the map while keeping the general themes and overall geometric designs of the original map.\n\nUpdate 1 (September 22,2009):\n*Bug fixes\n*added particles for teleports\n*added sounds\n*added more items\n*reshaped the teleport structure in the right base and the small towers on either side of the left base\n*removed the dock thing in the front\n*reduced fog\n*fixed some lighting problems\n\nUpdate 2 (October 10, 2009):\n*added waypoints - These may not work perfectly since this map is very vertical in design.\n*made some geometry more rounded\n*reduced lighting quality to achieve a smaller size - This created a lot of lighting bugs so players are advised to calclights on their own with a lighting precision of 32 or so.\n*altered some item placement slightly\n*fixed a few geometry bugs in the center building\n*redid the large launch teleport in the right building for the second time\n*New screenshot!!!\n\nCurrent State:\nThis map is unfinished and, for several reasons, I am likely never to finish it. This is why:\n\n*As much as I tried with this update to the map, I could not make the gameplay what it should be. To really get an appropriate layout for gameplay, I would really have to change so much of the design that most of the original map would be lost.\n*The textures lack detail and I have already completely retextured the map twice, but those retexturing were only with the 4 textures seen in the final version. To do texturing correctly would require to much more time.\n*I was not able to realize my vision of the map. I am not all that happy with the end product's look. Again, I might as well make a completely new map.\n\nThe original map: http://quadropolis.us/node/392\nThe sky box: http://quadropolis.us/node/2119\n\nI recommend playing the map with a slight amount of bloom.\n\nAlso, I am not quite finished with this map yet, but if anyone (hopefully the author) has an old or unfinished map that they would like me to update and revise in a similar manner, just contact me. The map must have some potential however. Overall, this project was pretty fun and I would not mind doing something similar again.\n\nMap file skycastle-r.zip (5.6 MB)\nRating\n281\npoints\n (30 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

It is based in an abandoned mine, long since thought to have run dry untill a group of CLA find a new strain of iron and precious metal deep within the mine. The RVSF find out about this, and they fight a battle for control of the mines. The map is quite detailed, and the gameplay is designed to be as fair as possible for both teams. Constructive criticism is appreciated. Thanks to Takk|oNe|n for help with the map.

Ever since \"Omega Wireframe Texture Pack\" by BionicCryonic (Node 2004) i played with the idea of doing some of this type of textures of my own, the textures work best with a black skybox and ambient set to 128, no lightsources whatsoever, perhaps for larger levels with a bit of black fog.\n\nNow i had a large level in mind based on an old game called Spindizzy wich was release by Electric Dreams Software in the UK way back in 1986, thats right, 23 years ago, a time when processor speeds run in single digits (like 3 mhz) and memory was measured in kilobytes, yet in this 48k they managed to fit a world that would take hours to explore.\n\nSadly Electric Dreams Software still denies distribution of the orginal game, and even if the had released in into the public domain it still does not allow me to recreate the whole Spindizzy world (wich is vast!!), so i only took inspiration from the original graphics upon wich i made the textures for this map, \"Frostbite\" was the most obvious choice for re-texturing.\n\nhttp://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004756\nMore info on Spindizzy\n\nHope you enjoy and please give comments and such.\nEdit: Fixed the package.cfg in the zipfile, changed BlikjeBier to blikjebier.\n\nOh another thing, in the zipfile is a Jpg-file called \"WIP Pontifex.jpg\", this could be my next map, but i need to obtain a permission first if i am going to release this, the map as it is, is about 90% finished.\n\nMap file onebite.zip (609.42 KB)\nRating\n33\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Healthboost for the patient.\n7. Less ammo for the king (he always had no health nearby)\n8. Removed king's jumppad (didn't like it anyways)\n9. green armor on the way up.\n10. Teleport to the near-top.\n11. Changed it into a FEMALE power phantasy map by using palm trees :-)\n\nAll the other king's handicaps remain: small & exposed surface area, poor line-of-sight, no health, being surrounded, etc. Seems the quad is the only reason to be up there now, and it may no longer be a KOTH map o.O.\n\nP.S. Waypoints are wonked, but the bots act better now.\n\n------\n\nHowdy people. I'm fresh here, so I decided to give a map as sort of a welcome gift. It's more of a concept map than anything, since I'll be making more complex maps based on the king of the hill theme.\n\nAll the goodies are at the top for all modes (capture, ctf, deathmatch, etc.), and you're at a severe disadvantage at the bottom. It's NOT a run-and-gun -- more like a map of attrition :-). It scales pretty well, maybe up to 16 players might work [!]. Some interesting features:\n\n1. A capture base is inaccessible so that whoever dominates the top will win.\n2. Deathmatch players spawn from the sky (heh) and can maneuver into the water, pyramid, or the back wall whilst falling.\n3. Gold-like shader effect (turn shader detail to high to see it)\n4. The steepest slope anyone can climb!\n\nIn the screenshot, the waterfall has refraction off so that the silver can shine through.\n\nBots act bizarre on the map, but ah well.

This map known from Q3 Arena as Deathmatch 17 is a much more pretty version to bring that famous Q3 feeling to Sauerbraten.\nI suggest it to be played with 4-8 players - but technically there can be up to 16 without probs. It takes use of the trak5 textures that must be downloaded to play this.\n\nWARNING: content requires the trak5 texture package, either download the textures here (http://quadropolis.us/node/1877 ) or get the complete package at the tc-forum (http://the-conquerors.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1237 ) (filesize would be to high including the textures).\n\nOriginally this map was designed by viruz and the original can still be found here: http://www.quadropolis.us/node/2088\n\nIn fact this is more an extendsion/ redo than a new map. But in order to convince you about this version I want to give a little list of upgraded things:\nList of canges:\n-fixed all jumppads to work perfectly (and as you're used to it from Q3)\n-took use of much more various textures\n-modeled very detailed mapobjects (combined with some really pretty textures they look very eyecandy)\n-added really pretty lightscene\n-added a bright moon in order to spend more light to parts of the map that were very dark\n-tweaked weapon and item placement (more Q3 like and much more balanced)\n-added some clip/no clip areas in order to give the map that desired feeling of Q3 (run around everywhere without being stopped by a clipping edge)\n-redone sniper plattform (more like in Q3 now) so that it's harder to use rockets against snipers. It's still working but you have to aim a little more.\n-as a little joke there is a deadly steam vent at the lowest plattform ;-)\n-improved performance of the hole map, it's now very balanced and runs without any fps lack\n-and many more little things...\n\nAt least you may have to test both to get your favourite...\nHowever I would like to get a little feedback from you about your impressions of it.\n\nchangelog:\nv1.1\nfixed mapname to a recommend one (viruz posted it)\nv1.2\ndone last fixes on some no clip areas\nmade it easier to get the chaingun (-just run over that little ramp to get back to mainplatform, it'll work if your're fast enough trust me)\n\nMap file qarena_dm17.zip (908.03 KB)\nRating\n48\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

You may use, modify and release the crosshairs as you wish, just give me credit.\n\nThere are 6 different cross hairs with two variations (30% transparency, full transparency in the circle) and a hit and teammate crosshair (alltogether 14 crosshairs).\n\nI created these crosshairs as I was not satisfied with the current ones. Particularly I wanted clean and round crosshairs that would remain visible on all surfaces and would be fine for shooting and sniping. I also wanted a better kill feedback at small crosshair sizes hence the red color for the 'hit' crosshair. These crosshairs were inspired by the dual crosshairs by PrimeEvil.\n\nThese crosshairs work best with crosshair sizes between 4 and 10. Set your crosshair size with /crosshairsize 1-50.\n\n===\n\nInstallation:\n1. Go to the folder in your Sauerbraten directory where the crosshairs are located (usually in .../data or .../data/crosshairs if you use a script to change the crosshairs).\n2. Select the crosshair you would like to use.\n3. Rename the crosshair to crosshair.png, the hit crosshair to hit.png and the teammate crosshair to teammate.png\n4. Make a backup of the existing crosshairs\n5. Replace the existing crosshairs with the new ones\n6.

Add this line and save:\nexec l_keys.cfg\n5. Open Sauerbraten and press F10\nThere will be one error message on your first launch of Sauer. Don't mind it.\n[6.

Its placed in the system on x56d, but after the strange emission form the near star and a the great debate from the creators, who does not wants to upgrade the maps to the last \"security\" standard, and the iCTF Game League, it was removed form the League.

I focuses more in gameplay than in graphics so the cubes my look really bad near the more detailed new map. But I think the game play can be interesting on this map due to the fact that you can make really fast run to bring the enemy flag at home.\nI have uploaded on Quadropolis to receive feedback for it, and maybe do an upgrade.\n\nV1.1\nI have done a massive upgrade at the map, some issue are corrected some (lot) no... i think the feeling is the same, but now bigger.\n\nV2.0\nSome update on the layout, now there are some glass that stop you to run from base to base in the central way. Also some glass close the maze (making it mazier). Some new platform are near the centre.\n\nThis map is full working in iCTF games mode. Items for CTF, bases for capture are only for testing prupose.\nThis map use no custom texure and the skyboxes is Eclipse (obviously).\nThis map have waypoints, but they are not good and bot locks funny, also they do not use all the map.\n\nMap file Lamiera.zip (4.84 MB)\nRating\n19\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nG'day Quadropolites, recently you may have noticed some changes to the way the rating system works, and now that I have it refined to Nieb's tastes I'm here to tell you what's up, and how it all is supposed to work; but before you comment, please understand that while the new system is open to refinement, it won't be removed or changed back.\n\nPoints instead of stars..\n\nThis is the biggest thing that you might notice. You can now vote any amount between 1 and 10. If you really like a node, rate it 10/10, and if you don't like it, simply don't rate it. This should hopefully fall in line with your own methods of giving feedback on content.\n\nSomething is better than nothing..\n\nUsing points means that no matter how you rate a node, its score will increase. High profile nodes are more likely to benefit from this than regular nodes. By switching to a points system, the only way to vote badly is to not vote at all, otherwise any amount of points you give will go toward the node's score.\n\nSticks and stones may break my bones..\n\nIt was felt that the old system was too biased toward people being able to \"rate down\" a node for various (what I would call pathetic) reasons, some of which included pure spite or hatred toward another community member. While we were able to moderate node comments, it was difficult for us to justify tampering with user votes, so this does the job for us.\n\nAutomatic conversions..\n\nThe points are just double what you already voted in stars (* = 2 pts, ** = 4 pts, .. ***** = 10 pts) and the new system converts these old values for you. Those of you who voted poorly on a node to bring down its rating may wish to consider canceling their vote.\n\nSo, while it may take a little adjustment, and there's far more gray area in what constitutes a \"good rating\"; we're hoping you'll like the new system better than the last and feel more inclined to give your two cents by rating a node. Don't be shy, you're just a click away..\n\n‹ Suggestion - Priority Waypoints Managing Material-Slots ›\n\nRating\n46\npoints\n (14 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nI have two problems. Hopefully this one post can sufficiently cover both.\n\nThe first is that when I have shaders enabled on Sauerbraten, it will on occasion crash out of the blue. I can immediately re-open the game and it will run perfectly fine. As indicated, I am using an Nvidia graphics card. For that matter by the way, what is that notice I get every time I open Sauer and it says it is using the Nvidia texgen bug workaround? These are all linked, aren't they...\n\nThe other problem I have is on the map I am editing right now, from certain vantagepoints some areas will go completely invisible. The blocks aren't deleted; in one area the water disappears but I can still 'swim' in midair. And if I come closer to the area it will usually come back into view. I tried deleting and re-doing the area, to no avail. I tried recalcing geometry, again with no results. Any suggestions? I recall this was an issue for me when I worked on core_transfer and now the officially released game doesn't have any problems. But on the update I'm working on, the problem is apparent once more.\n\nOh, and first post ever on the forums. :)\n\n*after Quin of course.\n\n‹ A few things Profile Picture? ›\n\nRating\n8\npoints\n (8 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I proceeded to blend textures, but I realized this texture was everywhere so I was blending when I didn't want to. So in the .cfg I removed the \"texlayer\" line to make it a basic texture.\n\nWhen I went back to the map, the texture had somehow 'blended' with the invisible blocks. I tried /clearblendmap and /clearpvs, as well as optimizing geometry (should that help..). I have also found that when I edit the blocks the texture is on (pushing it, then pushing it to the normal shape, for instance) this problem goes away.\n\nAny ideas?

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nThis tutorial is not from me, but i can recommend it to everyone who wants to learn cubescript for either SP maps or self use.\nbut copying it over before it vanishes ;)\n\ni think a guy called \"rknigh21\" made it have fun\n\nCubeScript\nIntroduction\n\nCubescript is the scripting language used by the FPS Sauerbraten/Eistenstern\ngame engines, it was originally developed by Wouter van Oortmerssen for the Cube\ngame engine. It's main advantage are high execution speed and compact syntax.\nIt's syntax is somewhat unusual and requires a bit of getting used to. If you\nare completely new to map editing in sauer I suggest reading editing.html in\nsauer's docs directory to get the basic hang of it. The reference document for\ncubescript commands is editref.html also in the docs directory.\n\nThere are numerous cubecript command most of these are to do with configuring\nthe engine and user interface. This tutorial concentrates on cubescript as a\nscripting language that enhances the gameplay. Generally I have organises this\ntutorial in terms of how to archive certain results, however some things are\ndifficult to fit into this scheme so please excuse the occasional oddly places\nsection.\n\nThis tutorial contains 6 examples with instructions to build then from\nscratch, however if you prefer they can be downloaded from here. Unpack\nthe zip file into the sauer root directory. The examples should end up in the\npackages/base directory.\n\nWhy use cubescript\nIf you\nenjoyied playing the great map LOST by redon in the latest release then that's\nthe best answer I can give. It alows the game to have much nore depth and allows\npuzells and chalanges to be presented to player which makes for a much more\ninteresting game.\n\n \n\nGeneral info about Cubescript\n\nWhere does cubescript go\nCubescript can be held in various places. Each map\nhas an associated file with the same name but ending in .cfg This contains\nspecific cubescript associated with just that map. Cube script that is required\nfor every map should go in game_fps.cfg for sauerbraten and game_rpg.cfg for\neisenstern. There are also some configuration files used to set up the engine\nkey mappings, defaults, etc\n\nCapabilities\nCubescript has the following\ncapabilities\n\nVariables and assignments\nUser interactions (and menus)\nControl structures\nRespond to events in the map \nManaging items in the map\n\nIn addition eisenstern has the following extra capabilities\n\n\nConfigure npcs and their weapons\nManage npc/user interactions including\nquests\n\nThis tutorial concentrates on standard sauerbraten scripting.\n\nMake sure you are in single player(sp) mode, campaign mode in the latest release or\nEisenstern.\nFor all these demo's you need to be in single player\n(sp) mode or Eisenstern. The eisest way to do this is to load a non existent sp\nmap with sp aaaa . This reports that no map called aaaa cannot be found but goes\nto sp mode anyway.  To work with Eisenstern start sauer with the\neisenstern.bat file.\n\nExecuting commands from the console\nYou can execute the simpler commands at the console.\nSo if you have sauer running and\nnothing is currently trying to kill you hit the \"`\" key (just to the\nleft of the \"1\" key not the one next to \";\"). This should open the command console\nat the bottom left of the screen and show a \"\\\" at the begging of\nthe line as prompt. Type\n\necho \"hello world\"\n\nfollowed by enter, should result in \"hello world\" appearing on the message output\nlines at the top left of the screen.\n\nTo retype a command line used in the resent\npast open the console with \"`\" then press the up arrow key, each press\nredisplays the previous line.\n\nAll the commands down to the examples can be executed at the console in this\nway.\n\nAll commands and cubescript examples are in italics.\n\nThe structure of cubecript\nCudescript consists of a series of statements usually one per line.\nStatements can be grouped together into block or held as functions that do a\nspecific job.\n\nCurved brackets ()\nAnything in curved brackets is evaluated first. So it\nis usually a good idea to put any calculations in curved brackets as you want\nthe calculation to be completed before the result is used.\n\nSquare brackets []\nSquare brackets are used to enclose a number of script\nstatements that need to be handled together. For example if a map fires a\ntrigger that\nneeds to execute 7 cubescript statements those statements would\nbe enclosed in square brackets.\n\nStatement seperator\nCubescript uses\nnewline as a statement seperatore or if several statements are on the same line\nthe \";\" may be used to separate them.\n\nComments\nAnything after a double slash \"//\" is treated as a comment\nand will not be executed. Comments can be on a line by themselves or on the end\nof a statement that is executed. It's a good idea to put plenty of comments in\nyou code, this makes it much easyer to understand afterwards\nand also help other who want to figure out how the code works. Comments should describe what section\nof the script does.\n\nUpper and Lower case\n\n\nCubescript is case sensative i.e. echo is not the same as\nEcho this is common source of confusion. \n\nSpaces\nCubescript is\nquite fussy about spaces, I normaly put a space each side of an\ncommand or significant code (like a bracket) just to be on the safe\nside.\n\n\n Variables, Assignments and\ncalculations\n\nStoring information\nVariables are used to store\ninformation that the script needs to refer to again at a later time. Each\nvariable has a name that is used to refer to it in the script i.e. num_uses\nor keyfound .\n\nA variable name must start with a letter and cannot contain any spaces or\npunctuation, they are case sensative. A variable can hold a number or a string\nof characters.\n\nVariable are assigned values using the =. i.e.\n\nnum_uses = 4\n\n\nor\n\nkeyfound = \"Yes\"\n\nTry this at the console. NOTE you must include the spaces either side of the\nequals.\n\nTo access the value of a variable prefix the name with the dollar sign \"$\",\nso to get the value of num_uses use $num_uses\n\nSo\n\necho $num_uses\n\nAt the console displays 4 at the lop left of the screen.\n\nIt is usually a good idea to give a variable a name that reflects what it\ndoes, this helps make cubescript much more understandable.\n\n \n\nInteger calculations\nCalculation are unusual as they use prefix\nnotation, that is the operation comes first so instead of putting 1 + 2 it uses\n+ 1 2 this needs to go in a set of curved brackets like ( + 1 2 )\n\nTo see the result of this try entering the following in the console (see\nabove)\n\necho ( + 1 2 )\n\nWhich should display 3 at the top left of the screen.\n\ncubescript supports the following integer calculations\n\n( + 1 2 )        Add 1 to 2\n( - 10 4\n)       Subtract 4 from 10\n( * 4 5\n)        Multiply 4 by 5\n( div 11 4\n)    Devide 11 by 4 returning the integer result (in this case\n2)\n( mod 11 4)    Divide 11 by 4 and return the remainder (in\nthis case 3)\n\nTo assign the value of the above sum to a variable use\n\nsumres = (+ 1 2 )\n\nif you need to use the value of a variable in a sum use\n\nnum1 = 5\nnumres = (+ $num1 7)\n\nThis would add 7 to the\n5 held in the variable num1 and store the result in numres, check by using echo\nto display the contents of numres ( remember to put the $ in front of the\nvariable name).\n\nMin and max\nMin and max return\nthe smallest and largest of two parameters e.g.\n\necho ( min 5 3 )\nech0 ( min 3 5 )\n\nWould both print 3 to the top of the screen because 3 is the\nsmaller of the two parameters.\n\nxPos =  47\nypos = 35\nsPos = ( max $xPos $yPos\n)\n\nWould set sPos to 47 because it is the larger of the two\nparametrs\n\nFloating point calculations\nCubescript also\nsupports floating point calculations, add a f suffix to the integer operations\nso +f is floating point add, to multiply 4.73 by 2.21 \n\necho ( +f 4.73\n2.21)\n\n \n\nControl Structures\n\nIF (making decisions)\nThe if\nstatement is used to allow cubesript to execute one set of statement over\nanother depending on the result of a logical comparison. For example if the\nplayer has the key then tell them they have a key otherwise tell the user they\nneed a key. This would look like\n\nif ( = $key1 1) [ echo \"You have the key\" ] [ echo \"You need to find the\nkey\"]\n\nHere the variable key1 is being used as a flag to indicate if the player has\nthe key (Contains 1) or not (contains 0). Test this at the console by setting\nvariable key1 to 1 with\n\nkey1 = 1\n\nThen entering the if statements above. Now set key1 to 0 with\n\nkey1 = 0\n\nand try the if again.\n\nMultiple statements can be placed inside the square brackets if required.\n\nThe following comparisons\nare available, both things being compared can be in variables.\n\n( = $key1 $cmp1 ) true if the number in variable key1 is equal to 1.\n\n( != $key1 1 ) true if the number in variable key1 is not equal to 1.\n\n( > $key1 1 ) true if the number in variable key1 is greater than 1.\n\n( >= $key1 1 ) true if the number in variable key1 is greater than or equal to 1.\n\n( < $Key1 1 ) true if the number in variable key1 is less than 1.\n\n( <= $Key1 1 ) true if the number in variable key1 is less than or equal to 1.\n\n( strcmp $hasKey \"Yes\") compares two strings and is true if they contain the\nsame string of characters.\n\nThe result of two comparisons (or more) can be combined with the following\nlogical conditions. Cubescripts prefix notation applies here to.\n\n|| or\n\n&& and\n\n^ exclusive or\n\n! Not\n\nSo to check if key1 holds 1 and key2 holds 1 use\n\nIf (&& ( = $key1 1 ) ( = $key2 1)) [echo \"Both hold 1\"]\n\nTo test this use the consol to set the variables key1 and key2 to various\ncombinations of 1 and 0 and execute the if given above.\n\n \nLOOP Repeating a block of code a known\nnumber of times\n\nLoop - Repeats\ncode a given number of times\nThis is used to execute cubescript statements a number of times.\n\nloop i 10 [ echo (concatword \"i holds \" $i) ]\n\nThis will loop the code in the square brackets 10 times, each time the variable i\nholds the iteration number. So in this case the numbers 1 to 10 will be printed\non the top line. Multiple statements can be placed between the square brackets if\nrequired (see examples).\n\nWhile Repeats a block of code while a condition is true\n\nThis is used to repeat a number of cubescript statements and check a\ncondition each time. If the condition evaluates to true then the code is\nexecuted and the condition checked again.\n\nwhile -\nRepeats code until some condition is true\ni = 1\nwhile [(< $i 10 )] [ echo $i ; i = (+ $i 1)]\n\nWhich does the same thing as the loop statement above. Normally the condition would involve a user \ninput or some other event from the map (see below). Note the square brackets around \nthe test condition, othewise the logical test is not repeated for each \nlool.\n\n\n \nFunctions\n\nBasic Functions\nA function is a number of cubescript\nstatements that together perform a given action. A function is defined by giving\na name for the function then the statements enclosed in square brackets. So to\ndefine a function that checked if the player has a particular key you could use\n\ncheckkey = [ If ( = $greenkey 1 ) [ echo \"You have the key\"] [echo \"Try to\nfind the key\"]]\n\nNote the square brackets at the beginning and end of the function. To use the\nfunction in you script just give the name i.e.\n\nTo test this at the console enter above function (exactly as given) at the\nconsole, set the variable greenkey to 1 or 0 with a statement similar to the one\nwe used for key1 above, then enter\n\ncheckkey\n\nAt the console, you should get one of the messages from the function.\n\nFunctions with parameters\nThe basic function is only of\nlimited use as it always does exactly the same thing. Say we had a map with 4\nlocked doors it would be much more useful if we could let the function know\nwhich key we wanted to check for, then the same function could be used to check\nall 4 keys. This is possible using parameters. Parameters are variables that can\nbe passed from the main program to the function. Inside the function the\nvariable is accessible via the arg variables, arg1 for the first parameter, arg2\nfor the second ,etc. Our modified function now looks like\n\ncheckkey = [ If ( = $arg1 1 ) [ echo \"You have the key\"] [echo \"Try to find\nthe key\"]]\n\nSet a value for the green and red keys\n\ngreenkey = 1\n\nredkey = 0\n\nNow to check for the greenkey use\n\ncheckkey $greenkey\n\nAnd to check for the red key use\n\ncheckkey $redkey\n\nThis can save a lot of repeated code.\n\n\n\n \n\nLinking some cubescript commands to a keypress\n\nbind - Link a\nkey press to some commands\nThe bind command allows a keypress\ndurring the game play to execute one or more cubescript commands, so.\n\nbind h [ echo\n\"Hello world\" ]\n\nWill display \"Hello\nworld to left if the h key is pressed durring play mode. Not this can be\nsetup inn edit mode but only works in play mode.\n\nSimilarly \n\ndsp = [ echo \"First line of display\" ; echo \"second\" ]\nbind n\ndsp\n\nWill run the dsp function when the n key is pressed. Not you\ncannot test this is edit mode so switch to play mode for\ntesting.\n\n \nManipulating strings\n\nconcat - Joins to strings together \nThe\nconcat command joins the contents of all the arguments together so\n\nfstr = \"First part\"\nsstr = \"second\npart\"\nres = (concat $fstr $sstr)\n\nWill result in res containing \"First part second part\". Which\nyou can test with echo $res. Note the extra space added where the two\nstrings join.\n\nconcatword does the same thing but does not add the extra space so.\n\nres = (concatword $fstr $sstr)\n\nSets res to \"First partsecond part\" which does not contain the extra\nspace.\n\nstrstr - Search a sring\nThis searches a string for a given substring and returns the starting\nposition of the sub string. So for example if\n\nx = \"Sauer is a very easy to use FPS game\ncreator\"\n\nThen\n\necho ( strstr $x \"easy\")\n\nWould return 15 because \"easy\" starts at position 15 (counting\nfrom 0). -1 is returned if the sub string is not found. So\n\necho ( strstr $x \"Easy\")\n\nReturns -1, remember sauer is case sensative.\n\nTo check if a string contains a sub string anywhere in its\nlenght use\n\nif ( >= ( strstr ( $x \"easy\") 0) [echo \"found\"] [echo\n\"not found\"]\n\nsubstr - Extract a spesific section of a\nstring\nReturns part of a string e.g.\n\nx = \"This is another short centance\"\necho ( substr $x 5 4)\n\nwill display \"is a\" which is the 4\ncharacters starting from the 5th character (the first char is zero),\nand\n\nq2 = ( substr $x 8 7 )\n\nsets the variable q2 to the stirng \"another\"\n\nIf only one parameter is given then this returns the\ncharacters from that point on to the end of the string so.\n\necho (substr $x 17)\n\nwill return \"short centance\"\n\nIf two parameters are give and the first is zero then\nthe second parameter returns that many characters from\nthe begining of the string e.g.\n\necho ( substr $x 0 4)\n\nreturns \"This\" \n\nstrreplace - Replace part\nof  astring with another string\n\nThis searches a string\nfor substring and replaces it with another substring so\n\necho ( strreplace \"This is a test of the xxxx command.\" \"xxxx\" \"strreplace\"\n)\n\nprints \"This is a test of the strreplace command.\" top left\n\nFormat - Formated a string\nThe format\ncommand provides an easy way to display the value of variables in a\nstring.\n\nmaxNoTasks = 7\ncurTask = 4\necho ( format \"You are on task %1 out of %2\ntasks\" $curTask $maxNoTasks )\n\nwould display\n\n\"You are on task 4 out of 7 tasks\"\n\nThe %1 in the string is replased with the value of the first variable, the %2\nby the value of the second variable. Up to 9 variables can be includded in this\nway.\n\n \n\nLists\n\nA list is a string containing a number of items seperated by spaces, a\nsentance can be though of as a list of words. Cubescript supports a couple of\nlist commands.\n\nlistlen - Number of items in a\nlist\nThis returns the number of items in a list\nso\n\nlst = \"item1 item2 item3 item4 item5\"\necho ( listlen\n$lst )\n\nreturns 5\n\nat - Extracting one item from a list\nThis\nextracts one item from a list.\n\ntstr = \"This is a collection of words\"\noneword = (at $tstr 4)\n\nWould set oneword to \"of\",\ncounting from 0.\n\n\nand\n\necho ( at \"00 10 20 30 40 fifty 60\" 5)\n\nreturnd \"fifty\"\n\n\nIndirect execution\n\nThis is about executing cubescript commands that are either held in a string\nvariable or a completely different file\n\n()\nIf a number of cubescript commands are stored in a\nvariable these can be executed by placing the string in brackets so\n\nlsx = \"loop i 10 [ echo (concat holds  $i) ]\"\n\nthen the command\n\n(lsx)\n\nWill print the numbers 1 to 10 on the screen. Complex programms can use this\nto constuct bits of code in a string variable and the execute them.\n\nIf the last command in the string is \"result\" then the value of the\nassociated variable will be returned and substituted for the expresion\nenclossed in (). \n\nexec - execute the command stored in a file\nThis allows a\ncfg file to be called and all the cube script it contains will be executed.\n\ncreate a file containing\n\necho \"Hello woprld\"\n\nSave this in the packages\\base folder with the name text_exec.cfg\n\nthen entering\n\nexec package\\base\\test_exec.cfg\n\nwhich will run the echo command in the file and display \"Hello world\" on\nscreen. Commonly used routines can be setup in a file and then called for every\nmap. This means that the cfg file for the map only need contain the code\nspesific to that map.\n\ngetalias - usine a variable to hold a\nreference to another variable\n\n\nIf v1 contains the name of another variable (say v2) then\n\necho ( getalias $v1\n)\n\nDisplays the contents of\nv2. This allows one variable to point to anouther variable. concatword\ncould be used to construct a variable name from several dynamic parameters and\nthen the value of that variable retrieved.\n\n\n \n\nInteractions\nbetween cubescript and the map\n\nCubescript can ineract with things in the map like doors,\nelivators and triggers.\n\nAdding a door to a map\nFor the next couple of examples\nyou will need a door to control. You could add a door via the menu but you are\nbetter of using the console as this give grater flexibility. To add a door via\nthe console.\n\n1) Ensure you are in sp mode.\n2) Switch to editing by pressing E\n(loads of debug stuff appears bottom left), and create a new map with newmap\n12  .\n3) Select a square on the floor where you want the door to\nappear\n4) open the console and enter newent mapmodel 27 11 4\n\nA door should appear. 27 is the map model of the door, 11 means it's locked\nand 4 is the tag number. You can move it around in the usual way by selecting it\n(mouse over it and click) and dragging with the mouse. You can rotate it by\nselecting it, holding down R on the keyboard and moving the mouse wheel.\n\nCome out of edit mode to test the trigger commands\n\ntrigger - Opening or closing a doors\n\nCubescript uses the trigger statement to open or close doors. When a door is added to a map\nit is given a tag number. This is then used by cubesript to control the door.\nSo for our door with a tag of 4 then\n\ntrigger 4 1\n\nWould open the door (try this at the console) and\n\ntrigger 4 0\n\nWould close it.\n\nAdding a platform or ellevator\nFor the next couple of\nexamples you will need an platform (or elevator) to control. To add a platform\nat the console.\n\n1) Make sure sauer is in sp mode\n2) Switch to editing by pressing E, then\ncreate a new map with newmap 12 .\n3) Select a square on the\nflore\n4) Open the console and enter newent platform 16 20 30 \n.\n\nNOTE sometimes you have to go in and out of edit mode to see a change to a\nplatform or elevator.\n\nThis adds a platform with a map model 16 tag 20 and speed 30. To add an\nelevator replace platform with elevator.\n\nCome out off edit mode to test the platform.\n\nplatform/elevator - Starting and stopping a platforms and elevators\nThis is similar to\ndoors. When the platform or elevator is added to the map it is given a tag\nnumber. The tag can then be used by cubescript to control the platform. So if\nthe map has a platform with a tag of 20 then\n\nplatform 20 1\n\nWould start it moving forward\n\nplatform 20 0\n\nWould stop it and\n\nplatform 20 -1\n\nWould start it moving backwards.\n\nElevators work the same way, just replace the word platform with\nelevator.\n\n \n\nAdding a trigger to the map\nA trigger can be added to the\nmap via the edit menu but it is better to do it via console.\n\n1) Make sure you are in sp mode.\n2) Switch to edit mode (press E), then\ncreate a new map newmap 12 .\n3) Select a square where you want the\ntrigger to appear.\n4) Open the console and enter newent mapmodel 24 3\n22  .\n\nExecuting code from a trigger in the map\nTo execute a\nfunction in cubesript when the player activates a trigger in the map the\nfunction must be called level_trigger_n . Where n is the tag associated with the\ntrigger. So if there is a trigger in the map tagged with 22 then to have some\ncode execute when the player activates the trigger use\n\nlevel_trigger_22 = [ echo \"You fired the trigger \"]\n\nYou can enter this at the console. Now switch out of editing (press E) and\nmove over to the trigger. The level should move and the message appear top\nleft.\n\n\n\n\nDelaying an Action\n\nSleep - doing something after a given amount of time\nThis\ncommand waits a given amount of time then executes the statements in the square\nbrackets.  Create a map with a door in it taged with 4 (see above) and try\nthe following.\n\nsleep 10000 [ trigger 4 1]\necho\n\"finished\"\n\nThis displays finished at the top of the screen then 10 seconds later opens\ndoor 4. The delay is in milliseconds so 60000 gives a 1 minute delay. NOTE the\nprogramme execution does not pause, the code in the square brackets is executed\nafter the delay but the statement after sleep is executed immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExamples\n\nEditing and the cfg files\n\nThese examples all need the cubescript to be in the map's cfg file. There is\na cfg editor as the last tab on the edit menu but I have found this to misbehave\nin unpredictable ways. Not sure if its me or the editor anyway I strongly\nrecommend that you use an external editor i.e. wordpad is ok or notepad. Any\ntext editor will work, I like crimson!\n\nWhen you save a map with the savemap myname command the map is saved in the\nfile myname.ogz in the packages/base directory. If you add a file with the same\nname ending in .cfg (in this case myname.cfg) in the same directory then any\ncubescript command in that file will be loaded when the map is loaded.\n\nUsing an external editor means that before any changes to the script are\nexecuted by the game the cfg file must be save and the game in sauer re-loaded.\nSo my editing sequence is\n\n1) Save the map from inside sauer\n2) Swap to the external editor\n3)\nEdit the cfg file and save to the same name as the map but with the .cfg\nextension\n4) Swap back to sauer\n5) Reload the map with the sp\ncommand\n\nExample 1 A Door Control\n\n\nCreating a map with\none door that only opens after two levers have been pulled.\n\nSetting up the map\n\n1) Make sure sauer is in sp mode\n2) Switch to editing (press E)\n3)\nCreate a new map with newmap 12\n4) Add a locked door with newent\nmapmodel 26 11 4\n5) Move back from the door a little way and add the\nfirst level (trigger) with  newent mapmodel 24 3 7\n6) Move\nsadeways a bit and add the second level (trigger) with newent mapmodel 24 3\n8\n7) Save map as tt_test1 with savemap tt_test1\n8) Swap to the text\neditor and add the script (see below)\n9) Save the script into a file called\ntt_test1.cfg in the packages/base directory\n10) Swap back to sauer\n11)\nreload the map with sp tt_test1\n12) test !\n\nHere is the script\n\nlev1 = 0\nlev2 = 0\n\nCheckdoor = [\nIf ( && ( = $lev1 1 ) ( = $lev2 1 ) ) [ trigger\n4 1 ; echo \"The door has opened\" ] [ echo \"you need to pull both levers\"\n]\n]\n\nlevel_trigger_7 = [\nlev1 = 1\nCheckdoor\n]\n\nlevel_trigger_8 = [\nlev2 = 1\nCheckdoor\n]\n\nHow this script works\nWhen the map loads the script runs\nand first creates the two variables lev1 and lev2 and sets both of them to 0.\nThese variables are used to remember when a lever has been pulled. The two level\nfunctions level_trigger_7 and level_trigger_8 are activated from the matching\ntriggers on the map. Both work the same way, first setting the relevant variable\nto 1 then calling the function Checkdoor. Checkdoor then checks if both\nvariables are set to 1, if they are it opens the door, if not a message is\ndisplayed for the user.\n\nRe-Running the map\nGoing into edit mode and back to run\nmode re-sets the map, that is the door closses and the levers return to the\nstarting position. It does not re-run the script so both variables lev1 and lev2\nremain set to one which means that the door now opens when only one lever has\nbeen pulled. To see the map work correctly again re-load the map with sp\ntt_test1 .\n\nDebuging Cubescript\nCubescript can be a bit trickery to\nwork with. If you do not get the cubescript exactly right strange things happen\nor sometimes nothing at all. Here are some techniques I have used to help sort\nout what is going on when a script does not work as expected (The above example\ntook 3 goes before I got it to work!)\n\n1) Try out an individual command at the command line. Sometimes a simplified\nversion of the command can be executed first then work up to the full\ncommand.\n\n2) Display the value of a variable with the echo command at the console.\n\n3) Add extra echo commands into the script so you can see if that particular\npart of the script is being executed. e.g. if we suspected that the triggers\nwhere not firing put an echo \"trig 7\" between the line level_trigger_7 = [ and\nlev1 = 1 . Now if the trigger is firing the echo command will execute and\ndisplay \"trig 7\" at the top of the screen.\n\n4) Start with a very simple script that definitely works then modify it in\nsmall stages towards what you actually want, checking it each stage that it\nstill works.\n\nThe newent mapmodel command and triggers\nThe console\ncommand \"newent mapmodel\" is a general purpose sauer command that adds a model\n(not a monster) to the map. It takes 3 parameters, these are\n\n1) The model number - These are defined in the file \"default_map_models.cfg\"\nin the data directory. This file links the actual model files to the numbers. DO\nNOT CHANGE THIS FILE!.\n\n2) The trigger type - These go from 1 to 14. Some interesting ones are 11\nlocked door, 3 trigger once only when first touched, 5 trigger every time it is\ntouched and 13 trigger once and disappear( to the player this looks like a\npickup) For a full list see editref.html in the docs directory.\n\n3) The tag or trigger number, for a door this is used to control it. For a\ntrigger it tells sauer which level trigger to run.\n\nSo a lever that operates once on trigger 7 would be created with\n\nnewent mapmodel 23 4 7\n\nBecause 24 is the model number for the lever model, 3 means trigger once and\n7 is the trigger number that we use in the script. A locked door on trigger\n4 is created with\n\nnewent mapmodel 26 11 4\n\nBecause 26 is the model number for a door, 11 means locked, and 4 is the\ntrigger number. In this case the door can be opened and closed by ref to the 4\nand also generates a trigger when touched on trigger 4!\n\nModel number -1\n\nModel number -1 creates an invisible trigger which the player cannot see.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2 - A door controlled by a key (pickups)\n\nCreating a map with one door and a key to be picked up\n\n1) Make sure you are in sp mode\n2) Switch to editing (press E)\n3)\nCreate a new map with newmap 12\n4) Add a locked door with newent\nmapmodel 26 11 4  .  Rotate the door by holding down R and\nrolling the mouse wheel until it is parallel to the rows of patters on the\nfloor. If you do not do this the collision box will not match the door.\n\n\n5) Add the key as a pickup - This is a special trigger that removes the\nobject when it is triggered. Move some distance away from the door add the key\nwith newent mapmodel 68 13 5 . Near the key pull up pillar so that you\ncan find the key again.\n6) Save the map with savemap\ntt_test2\n7) Swap to the external editor and enter the script\nbelow.\n8) Save the script as tt_test2.cfg in the packages/base\ndirectory.\n9) Swap back to sauer.\n10) Re-load the map with sp\ntt_test2\n11) test\n\nHere is the script\n\n \n\nkey1 = 0\n\nlevel_trigger_4 = [\nif ( = $key1 1 ) [ trigger 4 1 ] [ echo \"You do\nnot have the key\"]\n]\n\nlevel_trigger_5 = [\nkey1 = 1\n]\n\nHow this script works\n\nWhen the map is loaded the script runs and sets the variable key1 to 0. If\nthe player then touches the door it executes the level_trigger_4 function. This\nchecks the variable key1 and if it equals 1 opens the door, else it tells the\nplayer they need a key. When the player touches the key it runs level_trigger_5\nwhich just sets the variable key1 to 1. Now if the player touches the door it\nopens!\n\nAs before to re-run this re-load the map to re-set the variable key1 to\n0.\n\n\n \n\nExample 3 - Getting a trigger to open a menu\n\nBasic menus\nSauer has a menuing system that can be\nimplemented from the cfg file. These menus can be integrated into a game to help\n(or hinder) the player, anyway they allow for grater variation in game play.\n\nThe basic principle is define a menu in the cfg file then use a trigger from\ninside the map to display the menu. The options in the menu can then do things\nto the map.\n\nSetting up the map\n\n1) Make sure you are in sp mode.\n2) Swap to editing.\n3) Create a new\nmap with newmap 12\n5) Add a consol to trigger the menu with\n\nnewent mapmodel 21 5 4\n6) Save the map with savemap\ntt_test3\n7) Swap to the editor and enter the script (see below)\n8)\nSave the script as tt_test3.cfg into the packages/base\n9) Swap back to\nsauer\n10) re-load the map with sp tt_test3\n11) test\n\nHere is the script\n\nnewgui Console1 [\nguitext \"Hello from the console\"\nguibutton \"Close\n\" [ cleargui ]\n]\n\nlevel_trigger_4 = [ showgui Console1 ]\n\n\nHow this script works\nThe newgui command declares the\nmenu but does not display it. The showgui command in the level trigger displays\nthe menu. In the map the console is setup as the trigger so when the player\ntouches the console the trigger fires which in turn displays the menu.\n\n \n\nExample 4 - Using a menu to control a door\n\n\nThis example uses options on the menu to open and close a door. This\nexample is a modification to example 3.\n\nAssuming you have example3 loaded (if not load it with sp\ntt_test3).\n\nSetting up the map\n\n1) Swap to editing\n2) Add a locked door with newent mapmodel 26 11\n5\n3) Save the map with savemap tt_test4\n4) Swap to the text\neditor (if tt_test3 is not already in the editor load it)\n5) Modify the\nscript (see below)\n6) Save the script with savemap tt_test4.cfg in the\npackages/base folder.\n7) Swap to sauer\n8) Re-load the map with sp\ntt_test4\n9) Test\n\n \n\nHere is the modified menu\n\nnewgui Console1 [\nguitext \"Hello from the console\"\nguibutton \"Open\nDoor \" [ trigger 5 1 ]\nguibutton \"Close Door \" [ trigger 5 0 ]\nguibutton\n\"Close \" [ cleargui ]\n]\n\nlevel_trigger_4 = [ showgui Console1 ]\n\n \n\nHopefully this is self explanatory.\n\nNow when the player touches the console the menu open and the player should\nbe able to open and close the door.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5 - A menu with 2 tabs that\ndisplays some game info This is a\nmodification to example 4. This addes two levers and reports in the \"current\nstate\" tab which one of the levers the player last touched. I will just give\noutline instructions this time and leave to the user to work out the\ne\nediting sequence.\n\nModifying the map\n\nAdd two lever triggers\nto the map with\n\nnewent mapmodel 24 5 6\nnewent mapmodel 24 5\n7\n\nSave the map as tt_test5\n\nModify the script to\n\nstate = \"You have not touched a lever yet\"\n\nnewgui Console1 [\nguitext \"Hello from the\nconsole\"\nguibutton \"Open Door \" [ trigger 5 1 ]\nguibutton \"Close Door \" [\ntrigger 5 0 ]\nguibutton \"Close \" [ cleargui ]\nguitab \"Current\nstate\"\nguitext $state\n]\n\nlevel_trigger_4 = [ showgui Console1 ]\n\nlevel_trigger_6 = [state = \"Last touched lever 6\n\"]\n\nlevel_trigger_7 = [state = \"Last touched lever 7\n\"]\n\n\nSave the script as tt_Test5.cfg\n\nTest in sauer\n\nThis adds a second tab to the menu which\ndisplays the contents of the variable called state. When the map loads this is\nset to \"You have not touched a lever yet\". Which is what the player sees on the\nstate tab when the trigger fires and displays the menu. When the player touches\na lever the appropriate trigger is fired and the message in the variable state\nis changed. Now when the player triggers the menu and looks at state the new\nmessage is displayed.\n\n\n\n \n\nExample 6 - A Platform and Teleport Monster\nMachine\n\nThis example shows how to use a platform loaded with monsters\nand a teleport to drop the monsters into the vicinity of the player, it is quite\ncomplex.\n\n1) Make sure you are in sp mode, switch to editing and create a\nnew map with newmap 12\n2) Build a wall quite long so when the player\narrives on one side of the wall he cannot see what's on the other.\n3) On one\nside a short distance away from the wall create a platform with newent\nplatform 16 20 5 that moves parallel with the wall (select the platform\nentity, press R and roll the mouse wheel to rotate the platform), test which way\nit goes by switching to play mode and starting the platform (platform 20\n1).\n4) Create a second platform with newent platform 16 21 5 a\nshort distance behind the first, exactly in line with the first and moving in\nthe same direction.\n5) Put 4 monsters on top of each platform. To create a\nmonster at the console use newent monster 0  (0 is the orge ). Put\nthe monster entity's above the platform slight staggered down it's length. If\nthey are two close together they will displace each other and appear some\ndistance away from the entity. If the monster entity is to low it may displace\nthe platform entity which is bad news! as you have to remove all the monsters\nfrom the platform, put the platform back in position and replace the\nmonsters.\n6) Put a teleport in front of the platform with newent teleport\n10 , so that when the platform starts moving it carries the monsters into\nthe teleport.\n7) On the other side of the wall put the matching teledest with\n\nnewent teledest 10 .\n8) A short distance away from the teledest put\none monster (just to give the player something to do when the game starts) with\nnewent monster 1\n9) Back from the monster a bit put an invisible\ntrigger (this will start the platform via a script) with newent mapmodel -1\n3 4 .\n10) Just above the trigger put some shells as bait\n11) A short\ndistance back from the ammo put a player start,  facing the\nammo.  Pick the player start from the edit menu. \n12) Save the\nmap with savemap tt_test6  .\n13) Swap to the editor\nand enter the script below.\n14) Save the script as tt_test6.cfg\n15) Swap\nback to sauer and re-load the map with sp tt_test6 .\n16)\nTest\n\n\nHere is the script\n\n// Platform Monster machine R.Knight 15/9/08\n\nlevel_trigger_4 = [\nsleep 1000 [ platform 20 1 ]\nsleep\n10000 [ platform 21 1 ]\n]\n\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen the map starts, the play will grab the ammo (which fires\nthe trigger) and goes after the one visible monster. The trigger starts moving\nthe first platform after a one second delay via the script. The platform caries\nthe monsters into the teleport which moves them to the players location. After\nthe 10 second delay the second platform starts moving with the same\neffect.\n\n\nHave Fun!\n\n‹ Texture blending made blocks turn invisible\n\nRating\n30\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Content Creation\nSkyboxes for Cube 2.\n- By SkiingPenguins\n\n- August, 2009\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nA skybox for Cube 2 is 6 images; Front, Back, Left, Right, Up, and Down. These images are used to create a sky, or environment, in which the map is located. Many times, the skybox holds the sun, clouds, and inaccessible terrain. The terrain showed in the skybox cannot be walked upon by the player because it is just an image. More often then none, skyboxes are essential for a map to look real. In this document I will explain how to properly use Terragen Classic in an effort to create a skybox for cube 2. I will be using Sauerbraten Trooper Edition as the game in which I show how to import a skybox. I will also be using Windows and ImageMagick 6.5.4 Q16 (Refer to Links section for download)\n\n1. Terrain Setup\n\nIn this tutorial we will be using Terragen Classic (Refer to Links section for download) to create our skybox. I will not provide help for creating terrains in Terragen throughout this tutorial. Go ahead and create your terrain and world. After you have got a decent world in Terragen, place your camera where you want to render your images at. The camera orientation does not matter at this point.\n\n2. Rendering\n\nTo render your skybox, we will use a Terragen Script. The script is as follows:\n\nInitAnim \"C:\\myskybox\", 1\nZoom 1.0\nCamP 0\nCamH 0\nFRend\nCamH 180\nFRend\nCamH 90\nFRend\nCamH 270\nFRend\nCamH 270\nCamP -90\nFRend\nCamP 90\nFrend\n\n\nNow, save the script as “Render.tgs” without the quotes, using notepad or your favorite text editor. You will have to edit the line “InitAnim \"C:\\myskybox\", 1” and specify your own directory for skybox render output. Go into Terragen and click Terragen, then Execute Script. Navigate to your Render.tgs and run it. The script will output 6 images. These images will be numbered, and will be in .bmp format. These are not your final skybox images.\n\n3. Conversion\n\nAfter the script has finished, navigate to the folder where the script put your images. You will need to make a “bmp2png.bat” file… or something similar. The ImageMajick script we will be using is as follows:\n\nconvert 0001.bmp myskybox_ft.png\nconvert 0002.bmp myskybox_bk.png\nconvert 0006.bmp myskybox_up.png\nconvert 0003.bmp myskybox_lf.png\nconvert 0004.bmp myskybox_rt.png\nconvert 0005.bmp myskybox_dn.png\n\nYou will need to modify this script and replace “my skybox” with your skybox’s name. For this tutorial we will use “my skybox” as the name. run this .bat in the same folder as your images output by Terragen.\n\n4. In-Game\n\nNow that you have your .png skybox images, we can use them in Sauerbraten. Navigate to your Sauerbraten/packages folder and create a new folder. Name it anything you wish. For this tutorial, we will use the name “skies”. Copy your .png images to this folder. Now, go in-game into Sauerbraten and go to a map. It can even be a newmap. This doesn’t matter. Execute “/loadsky skies/my skybox” without the quotes in-game to load your skybox into the map. Your skybox will now appear. That’s it. Your Done. You’ve just created a skybox.\n\n5. Publishing\n\nThis section is not necessary, unless you want to share your skybox. To package it, we will use the .zip format, as it is pretty much universal. The structure of your .zip file will be as follows:\n\nmyskybox.zip\n\n/Packages/\n/Skies/\nmyskybox_ft.png\n\nmyskybox_bk.png\n\n/myskybox_up.png\n\nmyskybox_lf.png\n\nmyskybox_rt.png\n\nmyskybox_dn.png\n\n\nNow that your skybox is in a .zip, all someone has to do is unzip the .zip to their sauerbraten directory. That is all that they will need to do to install your skybox.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nThank you for reading this skybox tutorial. Good day to you.\n\n(THE END)\n\n7.

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nI'm picking up the idea of the \"Damage Volumes\" thread because I had an idea before. I thought it's better to make a new topic since this idea goes a bit deeper than just a comment in the other thread.\n\nI guess there are many who wanted to have a hurt-material, so it isn't a new idea. When I wanted to use it, I thought that if there was a hurt-material, there would be other martial requests because people come up with more than that.\n\nSo basically, this is just a concept idea and nothing like a perfected suggestion.\nWhat if the materials weren't preset, but they would work like textures. There would be a default material-configuration, and the possibility to create your own map-specific material configuration in the map cfg file (after using materialreset, similar to texturereset).\nThe player could give every material a name and define its functions, for example how much damage it causes, if it's clipped, if it's water, lava or air, the color it has and so on. It would allow you to easily merge two materials like water and death. I'm aware that it's already possible to add two materials in the same area, but it would be a lot simpler and less confusing to not have two overlapping materials, but a self defined \"water-death\" material (or however you want to call it in your cfg).\n\nIt could also be possible to make the material execute a row of commands, for example kill the player after or keep damaging him during a certain amount of time, or make him drop the flag - it would be up to every mapper to create his own materials.\n\nThe water, air, noclip and other commands would be replaced by something like /addmaterial [slotnumber], and the material menu would adapt itself to the material configuration, i.e. adding a guibutton with the chosen name of the material that adds it to the map.\n\nI realise that most likely there won't be someone who's implementing all this because I suggested it, it's rather just an idea that you can think about and leave a comment if you want.\n\n‹ New ratings, and how it works Can't take screenshots ›\n\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

Points are completely different from where the original was and hopefully they are balanced for such a small map. (yay?)\n\nFloor texturing is redone. I am bit worried that it takes away more than it gives but reviews will answer that for me. The idea is to make it feel less based on tech to have the glow and more about mystical magical aura... stuff.... or something. Even though I am unsure about it I did personally feel better about it and hope the rest of you do as well.\n\n- Update 2 -\nLights redone from scratch and the theme changed slightly to make it slightly easier on the eyes. The upper lights are now a coolish blue to contrast the warm orange the floor has. Hopefully it is decent enough for people not to have issues with when combined with the quake textures.\n\nMap file desperation.zip (1.83 MB)\nRating\n88\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Fairly self explanatory.\nJust like regular /replace but would only take effect within your current selection.\nEx. /replaceinsel\n\n2) Sync Sel. Similar to sendmap, but this would only send various peices of the map ( the part selected ) to be merged with those who already have the map. Useful for hight mapping on large maps where sending the entire map to keep synced is time consuming.\nEx. /sendsel or /syncsel\n\n3) Ability to make one item in a config apply to all entries below it via brackets and a marking character of some sort.\nAs an example...\n\n[!texture d \"jake/detail\"\n\ntexture 0 \"aard/aardfdry256_1.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/spring3.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/sqrlig02wb.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/sqrlig03bc.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/zdetlig01bb.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/zdetlig02bb.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"aard/aardmbr16_2.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/zdetlig04bb.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/zdet_trim2a.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"aard/aardmmet32_1.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"tech1soc/zdet_trim5b.jpg\"\ntexture 0 \"schwenz/dt_tile_check.01.jpg\"\n]\n\n‹ Polls Suggestion - Priority Waypoints ›\n\nRating\n24\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This is hardcore for ctf duel games.\nObviously, you can play 2vs2 ctf here, and it can work, but i think more than 4 players are simply \"a lot\" here; say to me if this is not the truth.\nI have put also 3 bases in almost each map, you can try to do a \"capture duel\", but a 2vs2 game should be perferct. Some maps works better than other, and they are not so optimized for this game mode. I can also understand that random base remove a lot of strategy, and i have not mirrored the bases too, but in capture, were you spawn, with weapons the gameplay is intact, maeby only a bit of more lucky. For same reason i don't like to play regen here.\n\nSo the map are:\n\ndb1r\n\nPowerups: None\nBases: 3\nTODO: Feel it empty? Need some models?

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Public Domain\nBlurb Custom sound to give verbal cues to armor spawns\nScreenshot \nGet original file (56KB)\nDetailed description\n\nSeems like everyone is using something like this nowadays, and it's unfair that mediocre players get an advantage over some good ones just because they always know the exact moment that armor will spawn. Some people seem to think it's cheating (which it's clearly not, custom sounds have always been allowed; this is even explicitly stated in the PSL rules and have received no complaint there), and some people complain that it's a cheap trick even though they use one themselves. The basic point is that this is being used by many players, and it doesn't amount to skill when such a player beats a player that doesn't have a timer.\n\nFor the record, I am not chastising anyone who is using one of these, I have one myself. I just think it's high time that this becomes public knowledge so no one is at a lame disadvantage.\n\nHopefully this will level the playing field and bring some new, more advanced, tactics into dueling. There are also team-mode considerations here for armor control. My hope is that it will weed out the mediocre players that win games based on a predetermined advantage and let the truly good players shine.\n\nI can tell you quite certainly that having this will not make you a better player. For those that are worried about duel tactics being lessened by this, I can also tell you that when all players are using this it leads to some extremely tactical and positioning-based games, where map control tactics become even more interesting. In short: it makes for awesome games with good players*.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Navigate to Sauerbraten/packages/sounds/free/ directory. Rename the file 'tick.wav' to back up the original armor noise. Move the tick.wav file given here into this directory. Go play a real mode (i.e. non-insta).\n\nNOTES: This sound will play for every armor on the map, not just YA. Obviously, just as you cannot hear a pistol firing from opposite ends of a large ctf map, you will not hear announcements for every single armor on a map. You will only hear the ones you are standing near. On duel maps you can usually hear every armor on the map.\n\nThis may be obvious, but I am not taking suggestions on how to improve the sounds. You can make your own. This post is just to open it up to everyone.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: Knowing armor spawn times does not help the unskilled. I, your beloved ConMan, claim no responsibility for your lack of improvement and/or you still losing 50-0 against decent players.\n\nMod file tick.zip (227.89 KB)\nRating\n50\npoints\n (8 votes)",

I'm currently adding specular and normal maps, but the weird thing is that these effects don't seem to show.\n\nWell, they rendered once - and there was so much glare that the map was burned into my retinas for a week. I'd like to make these effects a bit more subtle, but the engine isn't applying these shaders any more. Thus progress is kind of on halt until I can see the changes.\nDoes anybody have any ideas as to what's going on? Pixel shaders seem to work with the default textures, so it's probably the way I've packaged it. The only thing is that it did work once. Then never again.\n\nI've got a nvidia 9600gt gfx card, and all shader effects are enabled.\nMap config and texture package files are attached.\n\nThanks.\n\n‹ problem with obj texture For Me and My Fellow Noobs Please Tell us how to download and Use some of this stuff ....

    "content": "Content Creation\nAnimation Falling From the Sky\nLets define some terms: READ FIRST\n\nFr: frame rate\nSs: user defined as the square size for the user particular movie\nWd: width\nLn: lenth\nCs: cube size--the size of the cube in a texture in pixles-- smallest 8x8\nPx: pixel--one square of one color in a picture\nMts: Max texture size--the largest size that cube can import-- set at 4096 or 2^12.\nCell: defined as one piece (as a square) that displays part of the movie-- this will be later converted into a texture. \nGrid: defined as a set of cells (squares) that define one overall movie\nPixelated: the effect when you see little boxes of color. Like a low quality pic or mov\nPic: picture\nMov: Moive, Video, or other movie like multimedia\nMulti piece texture movie: a movie divided with a grid creating cells which are imported into cube and pieced back together \nMin: Minutes \nst8-^2: a term which means a number greater than 8 and is a power of 2  (ie 8,16,32,64 ect)\n\n\nNote: all cubes are 8x8 px and incress by *2 or st8-^2.\nNote: Quick interpretation assumes that you have flash 8 or greater. If you do not have flash read below\n\n \n\nQuick ez interpretation\n1:  Take a video and import into flash\n2:  Cut it into peices (based on the cart at the bottom)--you will divide your movie in a grid fashion--even pieces. \n3:  Export each frame of each piece as a jpg or gif sequence\n4:  Make sure to but these in folders that are the piece number.\n5:  Make a new folder called current.\n6:  Take all the jpg from the folder 1 (the first piece or grid cell) and copy them in the current folder.\n7:  Then take all the pieces and lay them to make one texture (frame 1 upper left and last in lower right).\n8:  Export as jpg.\n9:  Now copy the jpgs from folder 2 and pasted them over the pics in folder current (over top the images in folder one\n10: Go to the library and select all the images \n11: Right click and select refresh (I do believe)\n12: Export as jpg\n13: Do the above 4 steps until all the folders are done\n14: These are your textures.\n15: Take the textures and save them in a folder with your name on it.\n16: Make a config file with the map name.\n17: Define all the textures using the texture 0 command (i.e. texture 0 \"myname/1.jpg\" ... )\n18: Above the texture command define that the textures are using the Movie shader (the attatched file).\n19: Note you will have to exec the file on start so you can add the attached code to the bottom of the stdshader (data/stdshader).\n20: To define a shader put this code in: setshader MovieShader\n21: Note: the name MovieShader is dependent on what you name the attached code in the stdshader.cfg\n22: Now that the shader is set make sure to set the vars that are defined in comments (look at the code)\n23: The textures should work like all other textures. So simply line them in order and they should look good \n\nSee example: CFE's Movie Map\nThis was set by Chris, using my article (and my help) :)\n\nTips And Tricks\n\n☻ When making the first texture, use the align functions (window-align). Lay down all the horizonals then use the distribute command. Then group each row and distribute vertically. Note: make sure that the top and bottoms are perfectly aligned before you distribute or you will have gaps.\n☺ Before exporting each image piece (or cell) of the movie change the stage size to the size you need this way you dont make to much or to little.\n☻ Use the properties window to change the x y wd ln (this will make it more accurate.\n☺ Export as jpg sequence not gif sequence (gif has a lower color depth--which means less colors to choose from-- it will make it look pixelated).\n☻ Dont export at a fps lower then 12 or higher then 30.\n  \n\nWithout Flash\nUse any program that allows you to edit movies. Windows Media Player will work:\n \n1: Import the movie into the program.\n2: Start on the first frame and export each frame.\n3: Note if you want to have multi piece texture movie you will have to divide the movie before you export.\n4: Put each piece into a different folder. \n5: Go to a pic edit program (use gimp--its free)\n6: Import all the pictures in one folder.\n7: Lay the pics out--first frame upper left--last frame lower right.\n8: Export as a jpg.\n9: repeat steps 7-8 until there are no more folders.\n\nStart at step number 14.\n\nGraph And Cells For Your Movie\n\nNote: this is a graph that you need to look at.\nFirst find the length of your movie in min.\n\n   ln\t        px x px\n140 min\t        8 x 8\n9 min\t        32 x 32\n34 sec\t        128 x 128\n2 sec\t        512 x 512\n\n\nNow you need to figure out how much space you want your animation to take in cube. Take a grid size according to the cart and plot out the space you want the movie to cover in cube.\n\nSs     ingame grid size number\n8                1\n32               2\n128              3\n512              4\n♪ The easiest way to find your grid size is to scroll down your grid size to the bottom (g + downscroll) thats 1. 1 g + upscroll is 2 and one more 3 etc.\n♫ Now count how many wd you want. Count the number of cells in game. These will translate to the same grid cells when doing the process.\n\nFigure out the ratio of your movie 16:9 (rectangle) or 5:4 (square). Note it is best to use something that 9 or 4 can fit in. You need to figure out how many height that is. So simply divide your in game cell count by the width ratio and multiply by the hieght ratio---\n\nht = wd\nN    gc\n\n\nNote N is the ht count and gc is the ingame count.\nIf you do not know how to do this simply cross multiply here\n\ni.e.\n\n \nIf your in game count is 8 cells and you are working with 5:4 ratio. If i 8/4*5 i get 10. Now i need to put a 10x8 grid over my video and then render each cell separately.\n\nIf now your in game count is 18 cells and you are working with 16:9 ratio. If i 18/9*16 i get 32. Now i need to put a 32x18 grid over my video and then render each cell separately.\n\nNote: YOU MUST come out with an even number-- you can not half a cell-- it would be a pain in the @$$ :)\n\nExplaination\nProblem\n\nWe need to take a picture and convert it to a movie. To do this we must trick the mind by flashing images by the eyes at such a rate that it looks like it is moving. Cube does not allow us to use any file type but image files. So we must use some type of code to solve the problem.\n\nSolution\n\nTo solve the problem we must use a combination of code and texture format. Baby Rabbit came up with the code. Now we must apply the code to the texture.\n\nThe Code\n\nTo understand how to make a format for the code we must understand the code. The code takes an image scales it to a section (starting in the top left corner) of the texture and displays this area. Then it moves one cell over (cell means a distance of x value). When it reaches the end of the row it down one cell and back to the left side. Thus sliding thru the texture. If we can do this fast enough then we can trick the mind to think that it is a movie.\n\nFormating\n\n \nSo what we need to do is to make our movies frames line up with the frame that the code displays. So we simply line frame 1 next to frame 2 etc until we get to the end of the texture and then we drop down and go to the left side and continue. We do this until the image is done.\n\nMax Size Problem\n\nCube has a make size of 4096px. This does not seem like a problem until you have to display 30 images a second. To solve this we are going to cut our video into pieces. We will call these cells or pieces. These cells get exported as separate textures so that we do not reach above are make texture space. The smaller each cell the longer the image can go on. The cap is around 1hr 1/2 at about 30 fps. But if we divide it up too much we will run into the problem that we have too many textures to lay out which becomes a nightmare. It is best advised to keep your movies less then 9 min, because a game is only 10 or 15 min long and if you use 9 you can stay in the 2 grid size which will make it easier.\n\nCharts and Graphs\n\nOk so to explain the tables and how they work and how i got the numbers.\nFirst chart:\n\n   ln\t        px x px\n140 min\t        8 x 8\n9 min\t        32 x 32\n34 sec\t        128 x 128\n2 sec\t        512 x 512\n\n\nThe formula is:\n(((Ms/Ss)^2)/Fr)/60\nNote:\nSs: squ size\nMs: max size\nFr: frame rate\n60: because there are 60 seconds in a min\n---------------------------------------------\nThe formula takes the Ms which is a const set at 4096 and divides by a Ss. Ss is a set of the following: Ss[8,32,128,512]. These are st8-^2. This gives you how many Ss's you can fit in a strait row down your texture, but a square has two sides. So we square the sides because the sides of a square are equal. Thus more or less we found the area of the cube as the Ss was the unit of measurement. Then we divide by the fr. This is because we need to know how many images we need to display in one second. Now we have the amount of seconds that we can run our video, we divide by 60, cuz there are 60 sec in a min. Note: to find hours divide by 60 again.\nSecond chart:\n\nSs     ingame grid size number\n8                1\n32               2\n128              3\n512              4\n\n\nThis comes from the cube code. This is simply the amount of px that each texture takes when a particular grid size is used.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above should give you a complete understanding of the medthod in which you create movies. If you have any question post them, if you have any areas of the explaination you would like me to expond opon leave a comment. If you have question about programs (other than flash) to use for this process, leave a comment. :0 And if you have any ways to improve the process please comment. \n\nThanx \n\nYour Humble Master\nchasester\n\n‹ MULTIPLE KILLS & POINTS Rifle scope attempt (how?) ›\n\nRating\n18\npoints\n (2 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nMovieShader.txt\t590 bytes\nlogin to post comments",

The content stored here may not reflect the copy the game uses.\n*\n*\nStarred Content\nBlurb A new CTF map. *updated 3/8/10*\nScreenshot \nGet original file (195KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThis map is designed primarily for competitive CTF games (4v4). The layout is a little unconventional, but centers the action around a main platform in the middle of the map with plenty of ammo, a HB, and quad down below. The bases are easily defendable and also have an adjoining room with a YA.\n\nBasically, the map should reward the team that can successfully hold the middle ground, while still allowing the losing team to stock up on weapons and try to make a push out. This is my theory anyway since it hasn't been tested yet. :)\n\nSo this is a map for CTF, as forge was a map for iCTF. Please test it out and tell me if it works well or just ends up being a spawn-kill fest. I appreciate any feedback.\n\n(Btw, I'm very well aware that the planet mercury has no atmosphere...:P)\n\nEDIT: Some minor texture errors fixed, waypoints added.\nEDIT 2: Clipping/noclipping. Got rid of the ramp leading to greenarmour...the wall there was way too thin. Some minor detail.\nEDIT 3: Added a new area along with a third entrance to each base. The bases are much more accessible now and more susceptible to attack from the other team. Some texturing, clipping, waypoints, and other random crap.\n\nMap file mercury.zip (3.61 MB)\nURL qsclan.info\nRating\n48\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n*\n*\nStarred Content\n\nI'm no moderator or administrator, but I still think I should throw this out. This is to anybody new, or anybody who doesn't know already.\n\n1) Use a descriptive title for your thread!\nA title saying \"Question\" or \"Please HAlp!\" does not grant any relevant information as to the topic of the post, instead use something like: \"HUD missing\" or \"Can't see menu.\"\nTry to put the 'Subject' of your post in the 'Subject' box, ( go figure ) and save us all time. ;)\n\n2) Don't Advertise. Advertisement is not the purpose of the forum or node comments. I'd only reckon it would be permitted if it had to do with a new cube game, maybe..\nI've noticed it happen, though only in comments thus far.\n\n3) Refrain from trolling. If somebody IS trolling, just ignore them.\nIf your wondering, a troll is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages, and they more often than not want you to start arguing with them.\n\n4) Do not submit a post that requires the download of a file when not necessary. *looks to the criticism done in PDF *\nImages can be added to posts, learn your HTML tags.\nGlorious HTML Tag Help Page\nIf you must upload a file, make sure its in a format that everybody can use. Not all of use can open .doc or .docx\n\n5) Refrain from double posting. There is an 'Edit' button, it is there for a reason, use it. Also avoid from hitting 'Submit' multiple times if its taking a while. Most people realize that when you hit the button three times that you usually end up making three identical posts.\n\n5.5) Use the 'Reply' button if your speaking towards a specific person. It saves the trouble of going back and forth for the readers.\n\n6) Do not post a problem or idea on somebody else's thread, if it is something of relevance then make a new thread. We will never find your great idea if its buried in the middle of two thousand comments.\n\n7) Refrain from completely useless comments such as \"lol\" \"Awesome\" \"Cool\" \"Junk\"\nLots of us are guilty of doing such.\n\n8) Keep your signature short. I haven't seen any insanely long ones yet but still, a signature that is four miles long is by no means acceptable.\n\n9) Do not post files or links to files that are illegal. Ex. Warez, Cracks, key-gens, links to pirated software, etc, or information regarding how do acquire such. Common sense.\n\n10) Do Not Violate Copyrights!\nWe all know it, most of us have seen it. Don't do it.\n\n11) Try your best to help people as much or more than you yourself ask for help.\n\n12) Keep private conversations private, not on the forum. Don't share private information on the forum as anybody can see it ( duhh ) or carry on unrelated conversations.\n\n13) For the unlucky Thirteen, Refrain from ALL CAPS! Check your spelling, and one question mark, one period or one exclamation mark is plenty sufficient! If you can't spell, try a browser with spell check in it: Firefox, Google Chrome. ( there are more but I am not familiar with them )\n\n‹ Im new and not very good at scripting VIDEO... FAIL ›\n\nRating\n61\npoints\n (12 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "DeathStarPC | 2010-03-04 23:30",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Help and Support\n\nAs we all know, Sauerbraten enables users to host servers. This is a quick forum post to teach you the basics of hosting one.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nSauerbraten comes complete with the bat (windows), and launcher (mac), you won't have to download anything if you want a server. However, if you want a fancy server, you'll need to use a server mod. The list below are just some of the mods:\n\nQServ: https://github.com/deathstar/QServCollect\nSpaghettiMod: https://github.com/pisto/spaghettimod\nRemod: https://github.com/vasyahuyasa/remod-sauerbraten\nZeromod: https://github.com/andrius4669/zeromod-sauerbraten\nSuckerServ: github.com/SuckerServ/suckerserv\nHopmod: code.google.com/p/hopmod\n\nSETUP\n\nWindows:\nFirst off, you'll need to forward 2 ports to you hosting computers IP address, normally you can type your IP address into your web browser, this should bring you to router setup, once there find \"Port Forwarding\" then forward two ports: \"28785\" and \"28786\". The ports should be forwarded using TCP & UPD.\n\nOnce Sauerbraten is installed, right click it and select \"show file location\". You should see a file labeled \"server-init\", open it. Your whole server is configured here, you'll need to read the directions included in the file to finish the configuration. Once your done with configuration find the file labeled \"server\" its a bat file. Open that. If the Command Prompt window says \"Master Server Registration failed: failed pinging server\" then you've done something wrong, the server will be up but it won't be visible to anyone else that is not connected to your router. If it says \"Master server registration succeeded\" then your good! Keep that window open because the server will go down without it.\n\nMac OSX:\n\nYou'll need to forward 2 ports to you hosting computers IP address, normally you can type your IP address into your web browser, this should bring you to router setup, once there find \"Port Forwarding\" then forward two ports: \"28785\" and \"28786\". The ports should be forwarded using TCP & UPD.\n\nNow, download the attached \"server-init.cfg\" file, unzip it and copy it to your desktop. Open sauerbraten, the \"Sauerbraten Launcher\" window should come up, in the launcher on the main tab you'll notice text that says \"User Game Files\" and right next to it there's a \"Show...\" button, click it. Now that your in this file you can put server-init.cfg there. Open server.init.cfg and follow the instructions included in the file to complete your servers configuration. Now your ready to start your server! Open sauerbraten again and click on \"Server\" from the launcher window, leave the fields that say \"Description\" and password and the rest blank. Click \"Start\". If the mini-terminal says \"Master Server Registration failed: failed pinging server\" then you've done something wrong, the problem usually has to do with port forwarding, the server will be up but it won't be visible to anyone else that is not connected to your router. If it says \"Master server registration succeeded\" then your good! Keep that window open because the server will go down without it.\n\nFeel free to post any comments with questions, ill be happy to answer them.\n\nFeatured Comments:\n\nSub Zero | 2010-06-30 23:23\na few things i learned, i would run my server.bat with commands in them because the commands work just the same either in the server-init or in the server.bat (commands are: -d1 -c18 -g2 -p*** -n\"namehere\") (to explain to people who might read this what these commands do: -d1 (dedicating a server with var 1 for ingame server hosting) (-c amount of clients allowed at var 18) (-g2 amount of bots allowed ingame if not admin of server at var 2 bots) (-p password for admins) (-n for servers name)\n\nWindecker | 2010-06-30 15:24\nJust incase: If your one windows and you don't know your local IP, you can find it by opening the command prompt and typing ipconfig and hitting enter.\nYou should see something like this:  Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:\nConnection-specific DNS Suffix . : ***.***.***\n IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.100 \nSubnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : ***.***.***.*** \nDefault Gateway . . . . . . . . . : ***.***.***.***  \nThe local IP is the one labeled IP address.\n\nskiing_penguins | 2010-06-30 13:35\nfor the ip forwarding part, put the local ip of the machine the server is on. for me it would be \"192.168.1.100\" NOT YOUR EXTERNAL IP.\n\nImporting Blender models into Sauerbraten ›\n\nRating\n20\npoints\n (3 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nserver-init.cfg_.zip\t1.11 KB\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n*\n*\nStarred Content\n\nMost of these are from a wikihow page, with some modifications and clarifications- Just thought I would point that out there before somebody else noticed and started screaming \"PHONY!\"\n\n\"Criticism is to improve oneself and ones life, but not to insult or disgrace someone.\"\nWe use criticism as a system of finding and correcting possible faults to achieve a better end result.\nIf done properly, criticism is a good way to help us all improve our work by getting bits of feedback from other people, and their thoughts to help better the product.\n\nIf criticism is not done properly, for example: by one who is not a mature, diplomatic person, it may backfire. Backfired criticism leads to what may appear to be personal attacks or vastly opinionated arguments.\n\n1: Make sure you have a good understanding of what your criticizing before you do such. Put yourself in their shoes, see things how they might see them. Think how you would like to be treated if this was your own content and other people were criticizing it.\n\n2: Criticism should address any unclear areas and end with ways to fix them or improve them. Saying \"The stairs suck,\" Is not criticism, it's an opinion. Instead say, \"You get hung up on the stairs, this could be fixed by clipping each step.\"\n\n3: Address the good things along side the bad. Do your best to refrain from making the person who's work you are criticizing feel like crap. For an example \"The stairs need a lot of work, though the architecture supporting the ceiling is quite well done.\" This complements the work but also shows where a problem lies.\n\n4: Do not criticize the Person for their work, criticize the work.\nOne great mistake is to point out the errors of the person and not their work, refrain from insulting people or putting them down because you dislike their content.\n\n5: Don't use the word \"You,\" as it can make what your saying seem like a personal attack, even if your not intending it to. Odds are the person will reply defensively. This is a common thing that is prone to start arguments, like that of which occurred in a node here not long ago.\nAs an example \"You made a large error on the wall that causes players to get stuck,\" This could be changed to \"There is an error in the one wall that causes players to get stuck.\" Some people will put emphasis on the \"You\" when they read it which sometimes make it seem more like an accusation.\n\n6: Check over what you've said before you post it. Improper wording can lead to people interpreting what your saying as something different entirely. We don't have tone of voice in text, and if you word something improperly then someone may see it as an insult.\nImagine somebody saying \"Great work!\" First imagine it in a rewarding, kind tone, then in a sarcastic tone. The difference is made by the text leading up to the words, where as in real conversation the difference is shown in the way we say the words.\n\n7: I can't put enough emphasis on this, but check your spelling and grammar! This goes hand in hand with the previous point, and a criticism that nobody can understand is of little use to anybody. If your horrible at english, or just typing in general, thats alright as long as you try your best. If all else fails then try an online app: for example www.SpellChecker.net\nOnce your done, read it over a time or two.\n\nThis post was read over three times and revised twice.\n\n‹ Adding new playermodels Im new and not very good at scripting ›\n\nRating\n16\npoints\n (7 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

However, ten to fifteen minutes into the game it crashes. It usually goes windowed and refuses to respond, but it does a lot of unpredictable things- sometimes is spontaneously quits, and it once completely logged me off. I'm sure the crashes occur independent of my input- it's crashed when I'm standing still and when I'm computing lightmaps. It also crashes in between songs. This can get extremely annoying, especially when I'm playing multiplayer. I do have a few clues, however:\n\n-every time I kill the process my wifi signal is low.\n\n-When the error causes it to spontaneously quit, the screen is out of proportion- I can't reach the bottom of the screen with my mouse.\n\n-I was on the map Caves for about a half hour and it didn't crash.\n\nI have absolutely no clue why this happens.

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nHi all. What i gotten so far is:\n\nI have exported my model from blender to sauerbraten as an md3\n(i have like 3 different exporters (md3, md3 + shaders, 16 oct md3 or something like that))\nIs md3 the best file format to export and import for me? Will it make things more complicating?\nOr will md2 or another one suffice?\n\n-----\n\nKeep in mind that:\n\n- I just want the model to appear in sauerbraten as a movable mapmodel\n(wich i have managed so far)\n\n- Optionally i want to be able to load skin.jpgs unto different parts of the mapmodel\n(wich i have managed so far)\n\n-This mapmodel should react to the sauerbraten lightning.\n(wich i have NOT managed yet)\nFor now: my mapmodel WITHOUT skin.jpgs is just looking plane black,\nno mather how many lights i put around it, no mather how many times i type /calclight or /patchlight\nin sauerbraten. And WITH jpgs the skin.jpgs do appear, but they also do not react to the lights around them, wich makes the form of my mapmodel very very unclear.\n\n-----\n\nHow will i be able to solve my problem? That is: the mapmodel's form is unclear,\nprobably because my mapmodel is not responding to the surrounding lights.\nHow to make my mapmodel respond to the surrounding lights?\n\n- Is it something that should be written in the map.cfg?\n- Is it something that should be written in the md3.cfg?\n\n- Is it because i faulty exported my model? Not clicked an option during exporting?\n- Will it be solved by exporting in a different format?\n- Will i have to add new stuff to my model in blender? Or delete stuff?\n\nBasicly: what will i have to do?\n\nThank you very much for reading and or commenting!\nHappy modelling and enjoying blender and sauerbraten!\n\n‹ Is it possible to activate entities in single player or place entities without going into edit mode?

It's a continuation (and possibly refinement) of the Core Transfer theme. In response to criticism about the lack of balance in Core Transfer, I edited that map, but I also decided to design a symmetrical map. To keep it interesting I made each side completely different in aesthetics, but more or less the same in layout. Thus, pseudo-symmetry (copyright Kretren, 2010).\n\nThe map is designed for insta ctf but is compatible for all game modes. It's been playtested extensively with bots, but they don't explore the map as much as you guys will. You'll find a lot of the buildings, like in Core Transfer, can be climbed on.

Before the player activates the trigger, the entities must be \"inactive\" or maybe not even there.\n\nI am familiar with the trigger test map from the cube wiki in which the command \"beam_me\" switches you into edit mode, places a teleport, and leaves edit mode, but this is hardly what I want to do. I don't want the player to enter edit mode, and I want the teleport and the entity to be placed in a specific spot, not right in front of you like in the trigger test map.\n\nIs there some kind of script I can use to make a trigger activate an entity or place an entity in an exact location?\n\n‹ A drivable car Blender to Sauerbraten: -What format? -How to get the model to react to the lightning in sauerbraten? ›\n\nRating\n5\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

To succeed this, they'll have to jump from platform to platform by using certain weapons that are showed above the teleport, before they enter the room.\nWhen trying to jump from platform to platform, the player shouldn't get into the water, else he or she has to start over again by taking 1 of the teleports at the side of each platform.\nAll platforms in a room can be succeed with the weapons that are showed above the teleport, before they enter the room. even if it looks impossible without getting into the water, just think again. There is no room that can only be succeeded by using edit mode.\nInside certain rooms, there are signs on the wall or the floor. those are just to make it easier for the player to succeed the room. Some of the rooms in sauerpower don't have those signs, just because it should be clear enough what the player knows what to do.\nThe map uses this name, just because there aren't many first person shooters where trickjumping is pretty common and in the same style like Sauerbraten has (this counts much for the recoil, which is a very good thing in the gameplay of sauerbraten). That's why this is \"The Power of Sauer\".\nI hope people enjoy trickjumping on this map.\n\nImprovements\n(01)\nSome modifications to certain rooms has been done. this makes it easier to succeed those rooms.\nDemos are added! Every room got its own \"tutorial\" how it should get completed. For the newcomers, press ingame (not in multiplayer, only singleplayer) /demo name_of_demo. Don't put .dmo after the name, because it won't start up the demo on that way.

    "author": "Chasester_aka_you | 2010-03-29 17:18",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Help and Support\n\nOnly cuz every one wanted me to do this.\n\nLAYOUT DESIGN BASICS:\n\nThe best way to understand layout design is by studing. Forehense the artist in the 13 - 15 centuries studied from the great, so as you will want to study in the same way. Understanding why things are included in a map is important.\n\nFirst before you study such maps a metl2, 3, 4 or nmp9 or vallhalla, or curvedm, or etc. there is a basic understanding you must have. maps are layed out ahead of time working with large details such as place, time, movement(the way the map will flow:explained later), and layout.\n\nPlace and time are easily difined as the period in which and the location of which this map is to potray. Many maps have very generalize location, such as face capture an astroyed in the sky. Or more pacific as venice or battle of the nile. Point being that the place and time will render all of your details, for example having a computer station in the middle of a medevial style map would be illogical.\n\nMovement includes the following factors: type of map, number of estamated ppl on map, type of play styles(explained later).\n\nAt the begining of a map you must understand the mode at which you are gearing this map for(capture, ctf:regular and insta; deathmatch: ffa, insta, teaminsta, effiency, etc). This is important because if you are making a ctf map you need to make sides balenced, or if your making a capture map you need modules, or any other game type has its particular features (shown later).\n\nNext you need to decide how many ppl should be playing the game. For example you should not have a 2v2 ctf on valhalla, it is way to big, or have a 15v15 on face capture. The point being the more open space the more ppl you want to estamate for.\n\nLastly the play styles of people need to be taken in account. Many maps on quad exclude to include this very useful varible in the ideas of there map, which hurts the flow or rhythm of there map. I will outline some basic play styles you should account for:\n\nThe sniper, you need both camping spots and high buildings/ location were ppl can see large portion of the map; Note: making these to portion of the map too large will over power the sniper, and lead to spawn killing (killing someone just as they have reentered the game from being dead) or will stop ppl for being able to cross the map (CTF Only).\n\nThe camper, mostly in CTF this play style and is seen as noobish, but it is when a player sits in a location to gaurd a location or the flag killing ppl as they cross there scope. Example: boxes and barrel in the cave that goes through the middle between the 2 ships, or the small indentation by the flag on emplorium.\n\nThe runner, also a noob playstyle, in which a player runs to the flag and back to there flag with very minumial thought for there own safty. This is only in CTF play styles.\n\nThe assassin, a person who is really good 1v1 and is good at sneaking up on ppl, but lacks the ablity to dodge very well or stands still when they shoot. This style uses object on maps to trick the player into a bad position and the takes an easy shot.\n\nThe soldier, a person who is good a dodging and shooting, most of the time, good on open maps more then on closed maps with lots of objects.\n\nNow you can get to layout. This is the combaniation of all of the factors above. You must include all of these elements in your map. Example Face capture:\n\nSniper: to of the base.\nCamper: by the flag.\nRunner: One way in and many ways out, fast pace running and simple fast way.\nAssassin: inside bases many teleports and object very crowed by object.\nSoldier: the middle very open.\n\nThis is your basic layout factors. Now to show how these factors work for particular game modes.\n\nCTF: in a CTF map the more ways to get to the flag = more ppl it can hold. The general rule is that a map should have at least 2 defined ways to the flag, an easy (by speed or not having to do trick jumps or persition jumping) and a hard (by speed or trick jumping). There are exception to this rule, example Face_Capture. Also there are 2 balenced sides, this is extremely important, ppl need the map to be balenced, but not perfectly symetrical, example valhalla. The idea is the should have the same basic structures but it does not have to look the same, but the more detial = more symitry. Remember to make defencive and offensive spots for both sides.\n\nCapture: in Capture mods you should modulize the maps, meaning that you should have different area (either by rooms or distance or platforms) Example astroyes: there are 6 bases each is either on a different level or room. Astroids: on its own rock. Grenade cpt (capture point) is displaced from the rifle cpt and the shotgun cpt by elevation, or the stairs. The chaingun and the rifle and shotgun cpts are separated by rooms. The idea is to chain cpts on eachother, example: the rockets (on the astroids), the genade, and shotgun are all chained, to take over the shotgun or grenade you must avoid or take over the rockets cpts. This forces a movement around the map. The other chain on this map is the indside: rifle, chain, genades. The placement of all cpt weaponds have a rhythm to them as well. The rockets are allways above something but create a blind shot or are across from a rifle round (so a sniper can kill them). The genades are in there own enclosed room or share an area with an other cpt so they can shoot them down hill at a cpt. the chain gun is normally in an open area, shot gun is normally in a small room with many small inclosures or to conter the chain gun.\n\nDeathMatch: This is realy the most fluid type of gameplay, normally it is one of two types, either a lare square circle or other convex shape (a shape were all points are were the points exdent from the basic shape, rather than indent) around a middle, with a few out cropings: douze, ot, academy, aard3c. The other style is that of many rooms or areas(nmp3, orion) connected in some kind of path that reflects a square or basic convex shape. Example metl2 3 4.\n\nLastly when working with a structure, landscape, or building, work outside in. This will help define your theme better. What makes a maps theme is not what you can get to but what you cannot (map torture).\n\nThis is basic layout.\nchasester\n\n‹ Way Points Tips to help Chasester In the real World ›\n\nRating\n18\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nChasester, I've been reading these forums for a while, and have noticed you are (often) nothing more then a legal troll. However, I enjoy your rants every now and then, and whenever you speak you tend to get a lot of comments. Now you’re trying to step it up to the next level, trying to actually critique instead of troll. Some tips... (and this goes for anyone else who writes like they're five)\n\n** 1) Sound Intelligent.\nTry to organize your thoughts before speaking. Example of your unintelligent writing\n\"U ever heard of neon, it was not even textured, its in the assassine release if you care.\"\n\nCould be upgraded to fifth grade work by rephrasing the sentence as follows... \"Have you ever heard of the map neon? It was so bad it didn't even get textured, yet made it into the assassin release.\"\n\n** 2) Learn to Use Proper Sentence Structure.\nExample of your work\n\"Point being that something hast to have enough theme so that it has continuity through the map but not so much that to make it realistic it loses all flow.\"\n\nCould simply be rephrased as follows: \"A map should have a consistent theme, but too much realism is frowned upon.\"\n\n** 3) Learn Proper Spelling.\nExample of your spelling\n\"The runner, also a noob playstyle, in which a player runs to the flag and back to there flag with very minumial thought for there own safty.\"\n\nCorrected... \"The runner, a noob play style, is where a player runs to the flag and back without regard for their safety (much like a suicide bomber).\n\n-----\n\nWhile some of you may think it wrong to call a member of this community on the carpet like this, I think you and I would both agree that Chasester has benefited us enough with his negative comments and rants, to deserve, free of charge, a second grade lesson in grammar,dedicated to improving his intellect.\n\n--ADDENDUM--\n\nThanks for the responses, I want to ask you guys two things. 1) What do you think is Chaster's real age. 2) What age do you think he asks/spells like?\n\nYou can post your answer as follows RealAge/ActAge.\nExample\n\n156/182 (just random numbers)\n-----\nYou can think I'm wrong, but that's no reason to quit thinking.\n\n‹ LAYOUT DESIGN BASICS: I need textures! ›\n\nRating\n56\npoints\n (6 votes)",

Its main goal is to tie together Sauerbraten and Blood Frontier, as a sort of bridge between the two. Please note that this is a half-what mod, and as such may not be featured on Quadropolis. It is simply a \"toss-together\" of the two games, but it is clear that it is strictly tied to Blood Frontier. Thanks to Quin (lead developer of Blood Frontier), this project is possible. Without the help, I would never be able to put this together. Iron Fist is built upon Blood Frontier Beta 1 (0.80). I utilize a few open source objects found on Quadropolis, and give total credit to those whos works I use, even if I create a derivitive of it.

I am not 100% on what is used with Macs or Linux.\n- Words like “Noob” and other phrases used in “The Culture of the Internet” should be exempt\nfrom this Commandment.\n\nAND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST\n\nWhile nothing can be done to stop it. I think in ANY internet based community, multi-accounts are frowned upon.\n\nCommandment 13\nIf thou chooses to make multi accounts for any reason, and Mods or the community find out.\nWell nothing will happen but you should feel bad.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nJUST SOME OTHER STUFF\n\nWas anyone else TOTALLY THROWN by the plot twist of Chase being pwned by his bro?\nI was, and to be honest, I loled.

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nI have notice over my time at quad that many of the maps on quadropolis, fail to include a config or they fail to use a texturereset:\n\nMy personally preference is that every map should be required to do a texturerest because if ever the textures get removed or added to the pack it will mess them up. I was more or less wondering what the general consensus was about this matter. Should we require a CFG file and require a texturereset or is this not important. Also should we require that the wpt file must be inclued to be considered to be packaged correctly. This just gets really bloody anoying. Having to tag up on all the bots, of course this would not be required for conseptual maps.\n\nIf you could just leave your response on what you think about this idea, or add anything, take away or rephrase anything.\n\nThe Toll Under The Bridge\nchasester\n\n‹ Speed Mapping Client Idea - New Quad commandments? ›\n\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Help and Support\nWAY POINTS:\n\n*.wpt (or waypoint; * means any given file name) are a grid or trail in which the computer (bots) use to allow them to move around the maps. To create a *.wpt file.\n\nDo the following steps:\n\nFirst start by loading the map in which you choose to make the wpt. Then you will either add a bot (by hitting the insert key: for windows) or typing /dropwaypoints in the command prompt (by hitting the “T” key). Then to see these way points you will type /showwaypoints 1 (change 1 to 0 to turn it off). This will show up as blue lines on the screen behind you moving as you move.\nNext you will run around your map hitting all major points on the map (spawn points, flags, capture points, etc). An easy way to find all of your spawn points is to add a lot of bots so they spawn at all the points so you can tag them up (a phrase meaning that you run up to them so they can follow the path you are laying down).\n\nLast you save:\n\nAfter a while you should save. Saving is your friend, do it offend. To save simply type /savewaypoints, or you can save the waypoints as any name by typing /savewaypoints WHATEVERNAME. This works just like the save map function. Note: when you load the waypoints (by adding bots) it will load the one named as the map name (EX: mapname.wpt).\nTo load waypoints, (without adding bots, or from another map) type /loadwaypoints or the same as above to load any *.wpt in the base directory. The wpt will load automatically when you add bots.\n\nA few tips:\n\nStart with the easiest parts of the map then work to the hard parts, save the map after each part. In Blood Frontier this is not necessary because there are void wpts (if you fall off the map, fall in lava or death material, it will not save the waypoint). But for all other types you will have to save the map offend or if you mess up there will be a lot of bots killing themselves. -_-\nTo clear all the waypoints on a map you will type /clearwaypoints, to make it permenent, save the waypoints after you clear them.\n\nI’m sure I did not get all of the function that you can use so if some of the admins could elaborate on some of the \"hidden\" functions that would be great.\nAlso if you have anything to add please do.\n\nNOTE: all comments are subject to copy without quotation. :)\n\nthanx\nchasester\n\n‹ Converting Strings LAYOUT DESIGN BASICS: ›\n\nRating\n5\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nI had an idea earlier today and it goes with a forum post on speed mapping from a long time back. I doubt it is a new idea.\n\nI was thinking of a set features between client and server that would serve for speed mapping competitions.\nThe clients would have an editing lock, and the servers would be able to switch this editing lock on or off.\nThe master ( Player ) would be able to tell the server when to remove the lock, how long to keep it off and then in turn, when to turn it on. The server would simply allow the players to edit for X amount of time, then disallow them the ability to edit. With a timer this could be set up for 1 hour speed mapping competitions.\n\nA foreseeable problem is having multiple people on a single server resulting in lag and viewing of each others' work. In such a case multiple slave servers could be set up with a linking to a master server, this master server sending the start and stop signals to the slave servers, and from there the slave servers allowing or disallowing editing for their single client. ( spectators would be permitted )\n\nAfter the allotted time is up, maps could be uploaded to an external source for comparing and voting.\n^^ Expanding: A separate sendmap command, mayhap /uploadmap, would send the maps files of each competitor to the specialized master server. From there they could be taken, viewed, and rated.\nPersonally, I've always liked the idea of speed mapping competitions but unless everybody is in the same room it can be difficult to coordinate.\n\nJust my thoughts, feedback is welcome.\n\nEdit: I looked at the post again - This one - and there's talk of teams. Another feature allowing a specific number of clients per slave server could allow this, and allowing one person to be master of each slave server.\n\nMore thoughts: Lots of new servers are IRC linked, this can allow for cross-server chat, and team chat could be used to talk between yourself and your partner specifically.

I'm just kidding.\nI got this idea from Windecker, with his map from over here: http://www.quadropolis.us/node/2620\n\nGenerator\n---------\nI really taunted him of how much work he put into it, so i spent about 2 hours coding a small program in C to generate the maze then I made it into a rec file.\nA rec file is a thing that frogmod has, it basically dumps all editing commands into one file, which can be played back later.\n\nMaze Characteristics\n--------------------\nBased on the algorithm, there should be only 1 way between any 2 points in the maze. So that means no loops, and no isolated sections. Any loops are caused by a packet loss when the recording was played and they should be pretty obvious.\nDon't ask me how to solve it, I did not make a solver for it.\nThis maze has the same size as Windecker's\n\nRaised Walls\n------------\nThis was another idea from Windecker, which was very easy to implement in code. Basically there's these areas of walls which are higher, and they go along the structure decreasing every few cubes.\n\nFiles\n-----\nYou can find all the files over here:\nhttp://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/upload/sauer/maze/\n\nAttribution\n-----------\nIf you use my map generator I would appreciate it if you state somewhere that you used it.\n\nMap file automaze.zip (861.29 KB)\nURL http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/upload/sauer/maze/\nRating\n35\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

If I've forgot to say something that I've made, well, I've probably made that aswell. Everything that isn't made by me, you can see below in the acknowledgements.\n\nLast thoughts:\nDamn, the arm got ugly when lighted from certain angles...\nThe sound is balanced so that it shouldn't affect gameplay too much but still have a pretty nice feeling to it. I tried several different, but had trouble with sounds merging too much when lots of people play(loosing the sense of direction).

    "image": null,
    "content": "Help and Support\nMap Design Basics:\nTheme:\n\nThe most idolized maps have a balance between theme and gameplay. Theme is broken into two parts details, ideal theme (place, time, history, back-story, etc). The details of a map are important and overdoing the details is hard. To have details over done you would have to have some many cubes that the computer lags cause of it. Details many times make the difference between a good map and a noob looking map.\n\nIdeal theme, or time, place, so on, is important to the atmosphere this would include texturing, placement of detail, or mmodels (map models). This is more of a generalized theme stuff that is more closely tied to the gameplay or flow of a map. The best way to describe this would be: the details of a map are like the pieces, separate from the map, and the ideal theme would be like the putting of these pieces together to create realism and flow. For example you can have a wheelbarrow, this would be a detail, and where you decide to place this wheel barrow on the map will tell us about what the story, place, time, and so on of the map. Detail is most important because when people kill they want to spill blood on the wall; it makes them feel like they are killing and distroying at the same time :)\n\nGameplay:\n\nGame play should be throughout before you do your ideal theme but after you have your details. Of course you will not have all of your pieces but the general ones should be persistent in a grave yard (a pile of separate pieces). As you create the bass map, wall hills bases so on; you will start placing these details to enhance your map.\n\nThe commutation of the details plus the layout that is predefined will conclude to a solution in which you have both a well detailed map with good game play. If you do one before the other you will over power one of these aspects and the misbalances you map, and it loses its ideal form (essence of being). Details are pivotal to a good map and as such should be handled with the most respectable standards. Over detailing is near impossible, and extremely improbable. The only problem with too much detail is time, the amount of time over the given amount you want to spend.\n\nDetailing:\n\nDetails must fit the mood and flow of the map. In a proper map the map has detail that fit the theme, and do not prevent the player from playing the game. Detials should be realistic (correctly porportioned to other things in the map). For example, a door way in cube being 26 in across 7 feet in height is unrealistic for cube, but if you are to creat a door, keep in mind that all the pmodels are about 5 foot. If you proportion everything this way than a giant door way will look good.\n\nThe cubes are just fine and dandy but you need some more geometric shapes, say maybe a circle or a sphere or maybe even a slated cube. In cube one it was ok to make levels that contain many cubes and had very little detail because a lot of this detail was impossible (if you don’t understand do some research). Now in cube 2 we have to hold a higher standard on the maps that are produced. You need to work on the detail of your map, find a place to create, and create it.\n\nThe world is not a square it a circle, and most thing are not sharp cornered cubes. Therefore dont create thing that are perfect squares. The simplist minipulation to the cube will create a differing effect and therefore make your cube look good :)\n\nMapping off of realistic places is the easiest thing to do, because you dont have to worry about proportion or you dont have to think of thing to fill the map with. I would suggest starting with something realistic so that you can get the proportion of real-life into your creative maps.\n\nLighting:\n\nLighting is one of the most important, least important thinig. What i mean is the lighting changes the mood of the map completely; combined with the fog and the other minor function (ambient shadowmapambient skylight etc). Lighting completely makes or breaks a map, with out good lighting your map will look bad. You need to completely understand what effect you are tring to give to the user. What is the maps theme?; this directly affects your lighting choices. Pick a mood and use the light to create it. Look at any zombie game. The lights are dark, lots of shadows, red light, tight corrers heavy fog. This is mood, this is what makes you jump out of your chair when a zombie comes out of no were and kills you. The pure fact that humans are afraid of the dark creapy small spaces.\n\nPackaging:\n\nOf course see the packaging guide :) but some things that most of the sucessful maps have:\nA good screenshot: most people judge your map on your screenshot; firt looks, lasting impressions.\nWPT file: people like testing your map, so this is helpful :)\nReadme: Im not sure why but all good maps ive seen has one :) simply state your name, the map name and a basic storyline of the map.\n\nYour Lovable Jerk\nchasester\n\n‹ one clan question? dying.. ›\n\nRating\n7\npoints\n (1 vote)\nAttachment\tSize\nDesigningAMap.txt\t4.91 KB\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nHey, a while back I was playing on a coop-edit server with this guy. I have been playing Sauerbraten for almost 2 years now, but back then I was still pretty new to the whole mapping thing. He taught me how to do many simple things, such as how to raise your floatspeed, how to select corners using the middle mouse wheel button, and how to make ladders.\n\nHowever, there is one thing he taught me that I fail to remember (and after extensive searching, fail to discover). It is how to move/change/select the red cube that always appears on the corner of your selection when selecting cubes. I like to call this the relative copy point, because this is where your cubes will be pasted at if you were to copy the selection and paste it somewhere.\n\nLately I have been using ladders quite often, and it is very troublesome when that red cube in the corner when I select the ladder for copying is somewhere I don't want it to be. This makes it very hard to copy and paste ladders. I have been trying to figure out, once again, how to change the position of this red cube!\n\nIf you do not know what I am talking about when I say \"red cube\", start cube and create a new map. Create a medium sized cube in the air and select the whole thing. Look at each corner of the cube and eventually you should see a red wire frame cube stuck inside one of the corners. This is what I want to change.\n\nPlease, do not say this is impossible, because I KNOW it's possible. I did it before, and used to know how.\n\nAnd please, I don't care if it is really simple or if I could have Googled it (because I did), just give me the answer.\n\n‹ Does the src folder serve any real purpose?

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nI truly and sincerely HATE .md3/.md5 file formats. I would like to convert the program to run SOMETHING ELSE. My only real requirements are that:\n1) It be readily compatible with Blender;\n2) It be easily implemented into the game engine.\n\nMy motivation is simple. .md3/.md5 have frustrated the hell out of a great many people. You have to find some script some where that will work with your modeling software, find a way to run it reliably, hope to hell that it does not crash, and then find out in the end, after countless hours of work, that it did not save the frames of your animation, or that it did not convert them properly. It almost caused my to leave the Cube engine behind and fond something else.\n\nThe whole idea behind cube was that it allowed the user to create games quickly and easily! .md3/.md5 takes that whole advantage and tosses it down the drain. If you cannot make characters for the map, what is the point of making one?\n\nSO Please! If you can help me select a modern, cross-platform, compatible model format, one that can be easily made and converted in Blender, PLEASE let me know what it is.\n\nAlso! If you know how to write the Cube modification to allow the use of new formats, please let me know how so I can get this done and improve the engine as a whole.\n\n‹ Fanatic albums Music in sauerbraten (playing with \"music PATH\" command. ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nI've been playing Halo again. Having seen the awesome architecture (imo) in a lot of parts, I'm inspired to make another map. However, I know I'm going to have to negotiate with the Cube 2 engine.\n\nThe engine is based on the octree, whereby cubes are split into 8 smaller cubes, which are each split into 8 others, and so on. I've been able to make pretty detailed work with it. But when it comes to making perfect, seamless work, this system is not adequate. For example, when two perpendicular, angled sides come together, they cannot seam together diagonally like on a picture frame; the best we can do in Sauer is \"fold\" the corner over. That's just one example, and it makes detailed architecture difficult, and decent landscaping near impossible. It also makes detailed cylinders damn near impossible.\n\nI'm not experienced in graphics or anything. I've picked up almost everything I know from this engine, in fact. So I don't know exactly what it would take to create more 'seamless' objects in-game. Maybe it would take two different levels of rendering with different surfaces merging together, similar I imagine to how mapmodels work (again I won't claim to have expertise on the matter). But it wouldn't be a far stretch. My question is, is this feature omitted from the game for simplicity's sake (the game is characterized by being based almost entirely on the octree) or could it be included? I'm at the point where I can build really cool things, but the engine is starting to hold me back. I was considering mapmaking in Halo but I like this community enough to stay. That said, maybe we can import user-generated Halo mapfiles in?\n\nAnyways, some thoughts. I know a new release is coming out soon and it would be really cool to showcase it with some sophisticated maps; not to throw stones at anyone's work, it's all great, but we know we're compensating for the limitations of the cubes.\n\n‹ SauerEnhanced Justice Edition Port Looking for advanced map editor ›\n\nRating\n6\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Still has some design inconsistencies that need to be fixed. Like some of the buildings are built differently from the old style. If it feels cramped, just give it time. I promise you will figure out all the routes and be able to time things perfectly and feel like a boss. This map is supposed to be hard. It always has been. Its meant for the pro shooters. Recently I have put some focus on adding CTF to the map. I know its small. REALLY small. But I think because of how the map flow is it would make for some really fun fast paced CTF. Thanks for looking!\n\n-- Update 07/11/15 --\nAdded geometry\nAdded game play mechanics\nFixed more lights\nDefined bases\nOpened spaces\nStill working on CFG and custom textures.\n\n-- Update 1.5 --\nNew lights.\nCustom textures.\nImproved geometry and flow.\n\nThis update is several years old. Most was completed immediatly after the original release. After that it was fiddled with on and off. No player starts, no weapons, unplayable and unfinished. But, I wanted to show you the direction redon and I were headed and receive some feedback so I can finally finish my favorite project.\n\n-- Update 1.4 --\n- new sounds\n-- Update 1.3 --\n- new skybox (nightball)\n- new skylights, still night/dawn theme\n- new jumppads\n- new particles\n- some geometry fixed\n\n-- Update 1.2 --\n- a lot of texture/geometry/lighting errors fixed\n- more lights\n- various details added\n- brightened map (should be playable)\n- added fogdome & clouds\n\n-- Update 1.1 --\n- made the map brighter\n\nOh, where do I start?\nThe layout which was started by Redon is VERY old. I wanted to make a map so he came to me and said \"No textures fit this map\" so I downloaded TRaK5 textures and went to work on the map all the while adding bits of geometry that looked good while still keeping the flow of the map. After it was generally textured we moved it over to SVN and went to work on the more experimental parts of the map, like the waterfall. Penguins came onto the team to help with the waterfall, lighting, more textures, waypoints and some geometry which was a huge help. After a long time working on this map it is finally tweaked to near perfection. Hope you enjoy the map as much as we did making it!\n\nRequires the TRaK5 texture set.\n\nContributors: Redon, KI113R, SkiingPenguins, Razgriz, viruz, & Suicizer\n\nMap file Alloy1.5.zip (4.48 MB)\nRating\n102\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

We hope you enjoy playing them as much as we did designing them!\n\nBASEMENT is a small but complete game. Try to play it all the way and don't spoil it by going into edit mode.\n\nLike in the original early 3D-game \"Wolfenstein\" your goal is to escape from an underground prison. Once you've figured out how to unlock the doors and get to ammunition, it won't be that hard to eliminate the monsters, although you'll probably need a first-aid-kit from the secret room. \"Basement\" also takes some inspiration from \"Tomb Raider\". Brute force alone won't be enough to bring the game to an end, you'll have to think hard to find your way out of the confusing labyrinth.\n\nDesigned by Draakhond\n(final scene by Zaaikort)\n\nMap file basement-1-3-1.zip (3.88 MB)\nURL http://zaaikort.nl/cube2/mozaiek.html\nRating\n44\npoints\n (7 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

There are a lot of textures that just fit each other, as long as you know how to use them.\nAll textures are appearing darker ingame as they normally are. This is intended, because they look better when they are a little bit darker and also have the advantage that people are always able to make them brighter again ingame (by using vcolor 1 1 1).\nThere are several \"decal-models\" included, which carry some of the diffuse textures. They are intended to enhance walls as in decoration, or for gameplay-wise aspects (as you are able to shoot trough the alpha-channeled skin, just like air material). The map example shows of how to \"call\" them. Use them wisely...\nUsing the textures as skins shouldn't be against the license, as they carry the same license as any other texture in the zip-file (the license is just not putted in that folder; there's no need to put things twice in 1 zip-file).\n\nCredits\nI would like to thank Yves Allaire for such pretty diffuse textures!\nThe original textures can be found on http://www.evillair.net/v3/.\n\nSidenotes\nAlthough the license isn't stating so;\nDon't include these textures within your zip-file of your project (specificly maps, scripts, models, skyboxes, not stand-alone mods), but rather link to this page instead. If you are using modified versions of the textures; be sure to include those and pick another name for them.\nIt currently is licensed as Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0.\n\nThings to-do:\nNone; comment if you still think something should be done.\n\nImprovements\n9th of July 2010\n- Just did the same as with the dsi textures. they really are looking great now :D!\n\n12th of July 2010\n- Removed useless identical textures. decreased file-size because of that. I know some of the textures still could share the same normal map or height map, but some of them aren't that similar as they look like.\n\n3rd of April 2012\n- Cleaned up the mess I made long time ago. Almost every texture contains height-mapped textures.\n- Deleted several textures, but also used a special technique to specify a specular- mapped texture without any need to generate one outside Cube Engine 2.\n- Repackaged the texturepack so all textures are just in 1 folder, with just 1 package.cfg\n\n9th of April 2012\n- Be prepared to have textures be rendered on meshes instead, to let them work as a decal. As long as you're not abusing the meshes (like spamming around), it shouldn't be that heavy to render.\n- In other news; I made my first \"rigged\" model, can I be called an artist now =P?\n\n15th of April 2012\n- Finished all meshes and animations. Maybe some day I will try to make even better animated doors (like rotating also), but for now they should do the job.\n- Included a screenshot in the content (finally) and in the zip-file.\n- Finished the example map.\n\n16th of April 2012\n- Fixed some small mistakes (like still having red launchpad-textures at default, not having specified a height-mapped texture, etc).\n\n25th of September 2012\n- Fixed a small typo.\n\nAdvertising\nHere are some other texture packs which you might be interested in:\n\nMap file use_download_link_please!.txt (29 bytes)\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?mz3cm6ch3kw2vaw\nRating\n75\npoints\n (8 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Stable | Creative Commons (BY-SA)\nBlurb (Probably) one of the best texture packs that you could find for free!\nScreenshot \nGet original file (305KB)\nDetailed description\n\nInformation\nAnd here it is, the Evil-X Texture Pack by Yves Allaire!\nAll textures are sightable ingame, as far as I've noticed.\nThey seem to be some remade textures of several others which Yves Allaire has released in the past, yet they are in a completly new shape.\n\nA screenshot with some higher resolution is available right here.\n\nI hope you enjoy them!\n\nCredits\nI would like to thank Yves Allaire for his wonderful work for recreating some of Quake2's textures.\nThe original textures can be found on http://www.evillair.net/v3/.\n\nSidenotes\nAlthough the license isn't stating so;\nDon't include these textures within your zip-file of your project (as for maps, scripts, models, skyboxes, not stand-alone mods, etc), but rather link to this page instead. If you are using modified versions of the textures; be sure to include those in the very same directory and pick another name for them.\nIt currently is licensed as Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0.\n\nImprovements\n24 April 2019\nTweaked textures to be some more realistic (less plastic or glossy) and made another preview map which fit the textures differently. Both versions are included.\n\n8 September 2014\nChanged packaging and configuration so each resolution uses different folders. Both versions are now zipped in 1 zip-file instead of 2.\nPlease do not load the textures directly from textures/yves_allaire/ex but from textures/yves_allaire/ex/ex256 or textures/yves_allaire/ex/ex512.\n\n16 August 2012\nTweaked the configuration-file a little bit so they emit more specular light, while some of them are more shallow in sight now.\n\n15 August 2012\nRenamed all textures once more, but now they won't have ex in their names (to have less clutter). Converterted all textures to jpg-format to reduce the file-size (the link is still at the update of 15th July 2011). Repackaged the whole thing for some more cleaner content. Updated all links on the content. Added some proper screenshot and some map which shows off the textures a little bit.\n\n16 July 2010\nTenamed all textures to lower case letters. Added permission to put this texture pack on Quadropolis and to let any Cube Engine 2 games use them.\n\n15 July 2010\nRenamed the \"eX\" folder into \"ex\" and changed the config also. Added the lower quality texture pack as main texture pack for downloading (just because they don't look that bad at all and when you compare the 8Mb size against the 30Mb size, it's pretty useless to download the higher resolution pack, except if you're a detail-maniac). Of course the high resolution pack is still downloadable over here.\n\nAdvertising\nHere are some other texture packs which you might be interested in:\n\nURL https://www.mediafire.com/file/mwvobp1hy65fcve/ex_texturepack_20190423.zip/file\nRating\n80\npoints\n (8 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

The screenshots are named after the time (in ms) the client was running until the screenshot has been taken - that is totally useless for me. There is no support for the JPG-fileformat either. That causes file sizes around 5mb on my configuration which is way too much.\nI would have been happy if someone gave me this script - maybe some of you can use it as well ;)\n\nWhat does it do:\nIt checks your screenshots-directory for pictures of a specific filetype which you can define. It renames them according to their \"last-time-modified\"-timestamp, moves the converted files to a specific directory and backs the original files up (if you want).\nThe original files can be deleted as well. You just have to uncomment a line and delete another at the end of a script.\n\n-\n-\nUsage:\nOn a Debian-like systems (e.g.: Ubuntu) you will need to get the package \"imagemagick\" which contains an application called \"convert\".\nGet it with \"sudo apt-get install imagemagick\".\n\nOpen the script with a text editor and fill in your directory-paths and the filetype of your screenshots.\n\nMake it executable with \"chmod +x /scriptpath/scriptname\"\n\nExecute it and you are done!\n-\n-\n\nI'm not experienced in writing scripts, but I tried to make it as useful as I can. It is well commented so that an unexperienced user can also understand what happens where.

Thank you.\n\n- rbbbs\n\nMap file Chess.zip (83.84 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

What's more, you get one new and cool feature!\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAPB attempts to balance the amount of players (including bots) to a given value at all times, assuming you have master in order to use it, unless you are not connected, in which case it does not matter.\nAll you have to do to use it, is do /autobot #, where # is the amount of players you want to balance. If you wish to turn it off, simply reuse the command without a value following it.\n\nYou can also supply a second argument to pinpoint the skill level the bots added will be. A third argument will serve as the minimum skill range. It doesn't matter what value you give it, they will always be clamped to 1-101. There's a note however, bots will not change skill once inside unless they are \"replaced\". So you'll either have to shut the script down or start a new match for the new ones to come in. A feature to prevent that will likely come in the future.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy, and give feedback.

No it isn't. Q-Screen is more complex and way smarter as it has a detailed screenshot naming plan and support for custom names when used manually.\n\nThis script is able to \"temporarily\" capture your hud preferences and restore them when the screenshot has been taken without using variables. To use it, you can simply do /qscreen, and the captured picture will be saved with mode, map name and millis in the filename. If you decide to do /qscreen TEST, the screenshot will be saved with the name TEST.\n\nIf you would like to use it instead of the default screenshot bind, do /bind F12 qscreen\n\nEnjoy, and give feedback. Report any bugs or problems that you may encounter!\n\n--------------\n[UPDATE 24/07/2011] Updated for justice, now without variables at all. Mode names removed due to bloat and the difficulty in maintaining a proper list. Everything should work without problems. Replaces the default screenshot in F11.\n[UPDATE 25/07/2011] Bugs fixed, names now work as they should. Modes added back in. Added Justice compliant version. Fixed the stupid F11 bind to F12, sorry for any inconveniences.\n[UPDATE 13/11/2011] A nice update which solves the problem of the hud elements disappearing when taking screenshots too fast, thanks to srbs.

I believe this is because all the servers are \"auth\", (something that disables /setmaster). Most people are looking for a server where they can enter, claim master and load whatever they want.\n\nA big problem with XSBS is that it automatically sets mode to veto when started, even if its an \"auth\" server, this should be fixed.\n\nyou should only host a server for a purpose, for example a clan server where everyone meets, if you want more people to come into it you should allow setmaster 1, because this way people will be able to do what they want if the server is empty.\n\nServers outlined with the Oval are un-modded servers.\n\nhere are all the pages of the servers (1-6)\n\n‹ A Little Question 2 + 2 = 5 ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This is just because the original map in Quake 3 Arena is designed for ffa and so is this version. Waypoints are added and bots work properly so testing (or just playing) the map on singleplayer is no problem (they only got some problems with the jumppad close to the machinegun spawn place).\n\nMaybe a nice hint when playing 1 on 1 on the map: Think before shoot. This map has the intention that you got to take choices where your enemy would be, then consider with which weapon you should kill him/her/it and then really do the action.\n\nI hope you enjoy this map!\n\nCredits\nThanks to Yves Allaire for the e7 texture pack!\n\nSidenotes\nThe required e7 texturepack can be downloaded here.\n\nImprovements\nduring the time it has been deleted\n- Better and more contrasted lighting, to create a less boring layout.\n- Unsymmetrical, when it comes to gameplay and flow you'll feel more of that then you actually see, so try out first before you comment on that.\n- Waypoints has been redone on certain areas.\n- An input for the lava inside the lavatrenches, so it looks more realistic and solves the question how did the lava came in the map.\n- Packaging problem has been solved.

Of course, the \"Quadropolis Standards\" has been tried to reach, by adding more platforms in the map than its original.\n\nThe map is really meant to be played 1 on 1. When trying ffa with more then 2 people, pickups will be hard to get. The map looks very boring in first sight, but if you play it on several modes (especially insta), you'll notice it's actually pretty tactical and the purpose of some things which seem to be illogical when encountering it the first time, makes sense after all.\nIt's like it's original, designed for ffa and efficiency duels. Insta can be played on it either, but it's a bit harder compared to the other modes. The fog can be very useful to sneak away when your opponent has the quad or to confuse him or her while duelling.\n\nBe sure to give it a try before voting, because it looks pretty different ingame than on the screenshots. Just taking a match against a bot is no problem at all too, they haven't got any problem with the map (except reaching the upside of the walls in the centre)\nI hope you enjoy it!\n\nCredits\nThanks to Yves Allaire for the e7 texture pack, Drekow and Razgriz for playtesting.\n\nImprovements\n29-08-2010,\n- Another way to the upper platforms has been added, to improve the gameplay and flow (for the people that cant see it or are just too lazy to check out the real gameplay and flow of the map, it's a teleport that spawns you to the upperplatform with just 1 health on it, above a greenarmour thats spawning on a small pool)...\n- The centre walls are fully clipped now.\n- Lighting has been fixed on some places.\n- Jumppad geometry problem has been solved.\n- Screenshots has been updated.\n- Some pickups have been switched (the quaddamage is at the place where the health supposed to be, just in the air between 2 upper platforms. The quad has been putted on that place to give bots a fair chance too, else they somehow were never able to take the quaddamage, even though they could reach it. A rifleround is added where the quad was spawning).\n- Some more playerstarts has been added (especially on the upper platforms).\n- There have been added another lower platform next to the bullet spawn area and the centre of the map.\n- Waypoints have been updated of course.\n\n02-09-2010,\n- Took some fog away to set it to 250 instead of 200...\n- Unclipped the walls in the centre again (to increase the flow a bit)...\nThose improvements were probably the last, because there isn't much left to improve (except if someone suggests an idea wich would fit logical in the map)...\n\n14-12-2010\n- Added an awesome detail for marking there's a teleport; A \"kind of\" mirror of the place where you get spawned when you take the teleport. A screenshot is attached to this node.\n\n25-8-2011\n- The configuration-file has been updated so all textures also use a height-mapped texture.\n- The environmental texture has been converted to a .jpg-file to decrease the file-size.\n\n18-2-2012\n- There have been added 2 other ways for accessing the first floor.\n- There are also 2 ways to the upside of the walls in the centre of the map (which will reward players with bullets or some riflerounds).\n- Gameplay has been updated by the playerstarts and pickups which has been added (like those on the walls in the centre of the map).\n- The fog has been reduced (again), which makes you see almost every corner pretty clear (player still aren't able to see from side to side of the map, which keeps the surprise effect a little bit). It now also plays pretty nice in modes like instant gib.\n- A fogdome has been added.\n- The fogcolour (and the water) has been tweaked some more grey, so it wouldn't look like a sandstorm.\n- Skytextured all geometry which isn't in sight for players.\n- Replaced the screenshot of the teleport for an environmental-mapped texture. It looks less good to me, but it saves a lot of file-size while still carrying the same purpose.\n- Included all necessary textures and models.\n\n21-2-2012\n- Updated waypoints. Bot surprisingly aren't having any problem at getting the bullets on those walls.\n- Fixed some small geometry mistakes.\n\nMap file fi_13mar13.zip (848.42 KB)\nRating\n33\npoints\n (6 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nscreenshot_129254.png\t1.5 MB\nlogin to post comments",

The detailing would be mostly done with the use of models. Things such a statues, gargoyles, inside decor, etc.\nTowards the final release i will release models in a separate node. These will include:\n\nAdam & Eve (located in the front of the Notre Dame de paris)\ngargoyles (also same as above)\nscaffolding (if i go the unfinished church)\nchairs or random things\nTextures\n\nTextures will be released as Texture will probley be released in 2 releases and include:\n\na main texture (with 4 or five variances; the variances will be painted on over the main to create cracks and slightly ajar bricks)\n2 or 3 stain glass textures (one for the main rose marry and on for the south rose marry and one for all the stain glass windows)\nstyle texturs (some for the ceilings, painting on the walls, and other places)\nA couple of wood textures for varies items (pulpit, chairs, stage, etc) Note: some of these could be models\nfabric texture\nGamePlay ideas\n\nAs Windecker pointed out this map is quiet large (in file size) and is marked as an artistic map and a ctf, this is due to the fact that it is an artistic map, but as this engine is focused to be as fps i saw it fit to make it playable :) So this is an ARTISTIC CTF/CAP.\n\nThe main idea for the map would be cap and then ctf game play would run as following:\nThe 2 towers in the front of the map would contain the flag (north and south towers), there would be 4 exits (maybe 3) the windows on the four sides. Enterances would be from the stairs at on the lower north/south sides of the tower, and also from the roof (which would be accessed from the towers which from the cross (east and west). For capture these would be cap points along with one in the east and west towers and one on the stage.\n\nTheme Ideas\n\nI had 2 main ideas for theming:\n\nA unfinished cathedral (tarps over chairs pulpits ect, scaffolding, unfinished sculptures/paintings\nA Cube cathedral (cube pmodels/mosters as gargoyles/sculpture, painting/stain glass with a cube focus\nLog\n\n-Log-Oct 31, 2010\nSome work done on the inside of the north and south towers.\nNote: no release.\n\n-Log-Sept 24, 2010\ni have finished the front of the cathedral. The general idea is to make this mostly a cap map rather than ctf. I am looking at making it ctf capable and putting the flags in the 2 towers at the front. There will be 2 main entrances into the Towers:\n1. From the top. Through the roof onto the top of the tower. not quite sure how this is exactly going to work.\n2. Through a stair case on the side of the tower. this could either be a tele up to the top of the stairs or actually make you climb the stairs\nBoth these ways will not be ways to leave (the staircase will be one way cubes and the roof will be to high to jump.\n\nBoth of these towers are bell towers so they will contain a bell ;)\n\nWay to leave the towers will be from the windows on the four sides (maybe only 3). The Stain glass pain in the front (the big circle one) will be no-clipped so you can go through it to the stair case to access the other tower.\n\nAny Layout advise, question, concerns or comment would be greatly appreciated.\n\n-Log- Aug 23, 2010\nI started a constructing a cathedral. I'm going for a Gothic style cathedral. I need some help on ideas for detailing. Also I'm looking for help to make the level more playable. As of right now, it is a little elongated, i would like ideas to make it feel less grand. I'm looking at making it look like Notre dame in Paris. Any ideas on detailing or ways to improve gameplay would be great. Of course I'm always open to critique on the current level.\n\nThings to do:\n\nLighting\nAdd a North and South tower\nAttach the front entrance to the main vaults.\nAdd an inside design, staircase and other thing to the front tower.\nAdd statues sculptures reliefs etc.\nFinish the lay out including adding buttresses that create a cross shape for the building as a whole.\nTexture\n\nNote: Uses CFE's grass texture--not really needed :0\n\nChasester|YOU\n\nMap file Cathedral.zip (5.99 MB)\nRating\n13\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "BdR | 2010-09-20 20:12",

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nHi all,\n\nI've been playing cube2 for a while now, and I would like to create some maps. I've already have some floorplans of maps I want to make, but converting a floorplan into the sauerbraten editor is quite a chore. You have to measure and count cubes, and when the proportion is either too big or too small, you have to start all over. Which got me thinking...\n\nA long time ago, there was a conversion tool for the original Quake, which could quickly generate a Quake map from a .BMP file. The program would build the map based on certain colors that represented walls, doors and 'windows'. The program is still available, see the screenshots of it here:\n\nhttp://user.txcyber.com/~si_slick/bmp2map/\n\nI was wondering if something like that is also available for Sauerbraten?\n\nNow, I understand that a tool like that could never create a finished cube2 map, with textures and lights and everything. But.. it would be pretty handy tool for setting up a floor plan as a starting point for new maps. You could easily create .BMPs based on..\n\n- maps from other games\n- google maps\n- the floorplan of your house\n- any new map ideas\n\n..to create the initial layout of a map as a starting point. Right away you would have the basic layout, the corridor and area sizes, building placements, all the relative distances etc. You can use that as a starting point to edit into a better and more complete sauerbraten map.\n\nregards,\nBdR\n\nps: Alternatively, another question I have is; is it possible to edit a sauerbraten map using only console commands? So maybe commands like \"select x,y,z\" and \"raise x,y,z\" or something like that. If so, I think I could write a bmp2scipt tool myself.\n\n‹ Anyone know a good dds plugin for photoshop cs4 OSX How to Mod Cube 1 ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "image": null,
    "content": "General Discussion\n\nThinking about gameplay lately I noticed, how much higher and lower levels improve the fun in a map. One of the very few maps which go towards using both horizontal and vertical gameplay is nmp9, which is one of the oldest maps.\n\nTherefore I'm just gonna throw the idea in here: How about a CTF map with vertical gameplay? Would of course have to be a sci-fi map, I could imagine some duomo-like design. The basic idea would be both flags approximately next to each other quite at the bottom of the map. It must be arranged in a way that you can't reach one flag from the other, but instead have to go downwards to some teleporter-array bringing you back up on top of the map.\n\nAn advantage would be that there would be absolutely no need to make such a map symmetric, as the bases are next to each other. This would allow some interesting designs.\n\nI hope I could make my idea clear, if not feel free to tell me. I don't know if my idea is worth looking into or even feasible. As I said, I'm just throwing this in here as I'm no mapper at all, but if anyone wants to try such a design, I'd be happy to think about it more detailed.\n\nEdit: Very poor drawings added in a comment.\n\n‹ Okay, so we are now hosted on quadropolis.4-cube.com?

    "author": "Suicizer | 2010-10-23 15:10",
    "image": null,
    "content": "General Discussion\n\nTaking a certain name for a map can be tough sometimes.\nThat's why I'll try to give some tips for taking a mapname wich you can pick at best.\nOf course you can completly ignore those tips and just go on with naming your maps at random, it's your own choice...\n\nThe following tips to get a pretty logical name for your maps:\n\n1. Try to observate your probably half- or quarter-finished map and especially look at points like theme, atmosphere (lighting), texturing, details, geometry, gameplay and/or flow. When you name your map, take a few of these points and focus the name on that.\nSome simple examples of that are when you make a space-themed map, using \"space\" in the name (like \"lostinspace\") or when you make an industrial-themed map, using \"factory\" in it (like \"killfactory\"). Even tough this isnt very original but well get on that at the next point...\n\n2. Try to be original and not to copy names of other mappers.\nTake a name wich is unique and not taken by much mappers. So like a castle-themed map, don't take \"castle\" inside of the name of the map, but try to be original by taking names like \"fortress\" or \"citadel\".\n\n3. Try to use the points of the map wich looks better than other points of it.\nWhen a certain map has a better gameplay than it's atmosphere, try to focus on the gameplay then.\n\n4. Try not to focus just on 1 of the points wich is in tip #1.\nYou can only look at the theme, and call a church-themed map just \"church\", but you block other mappers of using anything with \"church\" in it, to still being original when naming. Try to be social and look further for focussing on another point, like gameplay. If a valley-themed map is created to play capture on it, take something like \"c_valley\"...\n\n5. Keep it short, keep it simple.\nWhen you keep the name of a map just short and simple, its much easier to remember than when you take a long name with uncommon words. Since Sauerbraten is from original English based, its not a bad thing to take an english word for your map (but do realise that you still should focus on a few of those points at tip #1).\n\n5. Taking long names isnt a bad thing, but...\nIt's not a bad thing to take a long map name, but when doing it, try to call it's original name only in the \"maptitle\" wich get showed up. Try to reduce the name instead. Because of reducing, it's easier to remember and takes less time to write down in a consoleline.\nTake as example \"loth\", wich has as maptitle \"Lair Of True Heros\" and ironicly in english, \"loth\" also has another meaning, wich brings us to the next (optional) tip.\n\n6. Take names with a double or ironic meaning.\nThis isnt a must, but it adds some interest for a player when writing it down to load the map. As example, \"curvy_castle\" is ironicly enough called \"castle\", but does it really looks like a castle? ...\n\n7. Adding your own nick into it.\nIt's not back to put your own nick in the name of a map, but try to combine it with some other point of tip #1. Else youll get several maps with almost the same name, were only a number at the end is the difference (like \"mbt1\", \"mbt10\", etc). This can be pretty confusing and isnt logical at all since there's no sense in numbering, exept the time when the map has been created (as example, \"mbt1\" probably has been made earlier than \"mbt10\"). Another pretty bad thing wich brings this way of naming is that you cannot see on the map's name it is a deathmatch or a capture the flag map. (as example, you can't see if \"mbt1\" is a deathmatch map or a capture the flag map, when you only look at the name). So when using your nick in the map's name, try to add at least gameplay in the name too!\n\nI hope these tips can help you taking a proper name. I'll repeat it again, it's your own decission to take a map name and to ignore those tips...\n\n‹ In game friend chat through steam.

    "title": "Home ~ Forums ~ Content Creation ~ How does guiautotab work?",
    "author": "Geo | 2010-11-19 16:21",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Content Creation\n\nHere is the problem... I've created my own simple jukebox. (which I will attach) It contains two menus. The main one that allows you to start from the beginning of the playlist, click on the song you want to play from, or call up the second menu. The second menu allows you to choose which directories are included in the playlist. The problem is, as the playlist gets longer the font size is automatically scaled down to show the whole list. I've tried placing guiautotab in various places (first comand in the newgui body, first in the guilist body, etc.) Eventually, I just created my own autotab function.\n\nI've included both scripts in the zip file.\n\nHow it works... First off, I created a folder named \"Music\" in the \"packages\" folder. I then added all the music folders I might want to listen to. (Including a copy of \"fanatic\" so I can rename the files with the title.) Then, in each of these folders I place a file named \"titles.cfg\"\nwhich contains the line 'songnames = \"...\" '. This allows you to choose which songs and in what order they are played. (I found a neat script in this forum that redid the playsong command that used \"loopfiles\" to automatically adjust the randomizer to any files added to \"fanatic\". But it would place them in alphabetical order only) Next, you add to your autoexec...\nsongdir = \"...\" // all the folders in Music\nexec myjuke.cfg\n\nthis will bind the 'j' key to the new menus and define 'myjuke'\nThe first time you call up the menu it will send you to the second menu. Simply click on all the directories you want added to the playlist. then click 'done'\nThe main menu is self explanatory.\n\nThis does not stop the 'playasong' from executing with every load. Simply enter the console comand 'myjuke' and it will play the current song on the playlist.\n\nAny help, comments, advice will be appreciated.\nBut, it may take me some time to get back to you.\nThanks in advanced\n\n‹ Config, textures and other catastrophes Help with weapon models ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nmyjuke.zip\t1.46 KB\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nI just want to straighten this out. When I go through the official Sauerbraten maps (also most of the ones you make on quad) I see a config file with tons of texture assignments. Is all of that really necessary?\nHere's my point: When I made my maps in the past, I'd just use textures from the slot, modified them with vscroll, vscale and voffset whenever the need was there. To me it seems much simpler than writing a dozen lines of code every time I start a new map. By the time I've finished locating the directory of those textures I want (not to mention writing those down), I might've already changed my mind about the theme -.-\nNow some people have told me that a config is necessary for official Sauerbraten maps, some tell me it isn't. Most aren't sure at all. The only thing I've used a config for up until now is to add sounds, my own textures or to name bases.\nSo, my question is: What other gain do I get from typing a whole config besides learning about configs? Because that alone doesn't seem to be worth it. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nAlso, I've heard a rumor that there would be some script which is supposed to write all used textures/models/ other assets into the config automatically? Now that would be dope, since it would save us all a great deal of work.\nThanks in advance.\n\n‹ New Water Commands?

    "content": "This unofficial guide is aimed to be moderated and updated by trusted members of the community in order to add and update the help provided for Frequently Asked Questions which often litter the forum. If anyone has a suggestion or an addition to this guide, please contact me by my personal contact form.\n\nThis guide will always be prone to updates and additions over time.\n\nGeneral FAQ\nMy maps do not show up in the maps menu, what is wrong?\nNothing is wrong actually. The maps menu only lists only the official maps the game contains, in order to keep it clean, fast, and in order. To view your custom maps, all you need to do is type /showcustommaps and another menu will pop up which will contain all the custom maps found within your game.\nMy textures do not show up in the texture browser, what am i doing wrong?\nThe textures defined in the texture browser are executed through default_map_settings.cfg, a config file located in the data folder. Placing a texture pack in the packages folder won't magically add it to the texture browser. In order for your custom textures to appear in the texture browser, you need to define your very own map config, and execute the texture pack's config from within it. If all is done correctly, the new textures will appear after the end of the default ones.\nIn case your textures really don't show up in the browser, it could mean you've made a mistake. Most common problems are mistyped file names, or wrong paths. Sometimes the format might even be wrong or unsupported, or the image its self could be corrupt. Make sure these cases are covered before asking for further help from someone.\nHow-To Guides\nUsing custom texture packs\nTexture packs usually come in their own directories along with a config named package.cfg which contains the order of texture, shader definitions and texture map usage. A texture pack cannot really be installed, since its advised NOT to modify the default_map_settings.cfg. The best and most compatible for everyone way is to execute the texture pack through your map's config file. This consists of adding a simple exec \"path/package.cfg\" line within the config, and then loading the map in order for the textures of the texture pack to appear in the browser.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog\n04/12/2010 19:30 UTC+2\nAdded the first How-To guide; again, more to come at a later time.\n04/12/2010 15:15 UTC+2\nInitial release, more stuff to be added soon enough to cover more subject, in gameplay, scripting, and more.",

    "image": null,
    "content": "General Discussion\n\nI would like to run a little contest here on Quadropolis, but need the feedback of others first.\nWhat I want to do is have a contest where I or another member uploads a very basic, bare bones template map. This map will be no more than a roughed out area with a few buildings and whatnot. There will be no lighting, no texturing, and no geometric detail beyond the rough shapes.\n\nThis Contest would take 1 ( one ) Node on Quadropolis.\nThe idea would be for people to download this template, and *detail* it. Each mapper would use what ever theme they choose. They will have to add geometric detail, textures, and lighting.\n\nBy detail, I mean DETAIL, in capital letters. The map should be held together in an attractive way. The style or theme used should support itself, and should not look half-done or misplaced. This does NOT mean it needs to be any sort of 'Realism' theme, so long as the visual style fits.\nLighting needs to be complete, and help convey the theme and feel of the map, as well as texturing.\nWhat were looking for is something to grab the interests of whoever is wandering through the map, instantly. The player should be able to look at levels of intricacy down to the smallest item, yet the details should not be a distraction from the map itself.\n( It's like walking through the map and being amazed at what you see, then wandering through it again and thinking, \"Cool! I didn't see that before!\" )\n\nThis is all about the artistic eye of the mapper. We want to see what people can come up with, and how well they can use they can use the engine to make an existing structure into that image they see in their head.\n\nEach map, once finished, will be uploaded and sent to an email address which will be specified. From there, the top 5 or 10 maps will picked out by the organizers, via majority vote. The top map chosen will be uploaded to the Contest node. This includes a screenshot and download link, so community members can download, discuss, and rate the final nodes.\n( other works that didn't quite make it will likely be accessible elsewhere )\n\nThe best works will be chosen by the community. S/he who's content is highest rating gets... erm.. bragging rights, or something. I'm still working on that aspect.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nPossible rules and guidelines:\n= Contestants =\n-You must turn in your work to the specified location before the due date. Exceptions \"May\" be made if organizers are contacted prior.\n-Your work may not have content copied ( and pasted ) from other works of your own, or others'.\n-Plagiarisation of work will result in disqualification.\n\n-Anybody can join. Age and language don't matter. ( hopefully any language barriers can be overcome, if they arise. )\n( Content may be submitted from people organizing the project as well. The maps that are voted to the top 5 or 10 are done via a majority vote, and nobody can vote for their own map. If the votes are very close for submitted maps, that top number may become larger by one or two. Ex. Top 12 )\n-Drastic geometric changes to the map provided are not permitted, such as moving a building or something large. A consistent base for ALL contestants is important.\n-Final entries must be complete. Geometry, light, texture, etc. Time management is very important for this project.\n-Anything in the maps that is discriminatory will result in disqualification.\n-Contestants who are negative to others during the contest also risk disqualification. We want a clean and fun challenge.\n-Mappers may keep a page updated with screenshots or info on their work, if they choose to. External feedback is permitted, but no changes to the entry are permitted by anybody but contestant.\n\n-Texture usage will be limited to included Saurbraten textures. Or maybe it won't.\n\n= Non-Contestants =\n-Any criticism given to the works during or after the contest must be Positive, and Constructive.\n-Everybody should keep a positive attitude.\n\n--------------\n\nI need feedback.\n\n-Does this project sound like a good idea?\n--If so, who would like to help run it and organize it? ( Quad Admin's would be ideal to help run the contest, due to good eyes, attitudes, judgement, and the whole nine yards. We want unbiased opinions on content. )\n-What are some things that could/should be changed?\n\nOpen for opinions.\nPlease try to ignore any spelling or grammatical mistakes. I'll fix them as I find them. ;)\n\n‹ does Red eclipse load .ogz? Quadropolis wishes ›\n\nRating\n26\npoints\n (8 votes)",

    "content": "General Discussion\nSchools Out - Holiday Detailing Contest\nContest Has Ended\n\nClick here to vote for your favorite map of the final five.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContest Forum\nAbout the contest:\n\nThis is a contest done solo, or in teams of two. Look at general Rules under the rules category for more details. You will be taking a template map and transforming it into a masterpiece. Contestants will have seven days, starting on the 22nd of December, and ending at midnight, on the 29th of December EST (eastern standard time, UTC-5). At that time, all the threads will be locked and a poll will start. You may rate your own map but your vote WILL be discounted. The map with the most votes will be deemed the winner. Bragging rights will be all yours, and maybe a little bit more. ;)\n\nContestants:\n\nYou will be required to start from a template map which will be released here upon the starting date of the contest.\nThis layout must be used for the contest, and the color rules given must be abided.\nAny drastic change to the layout is forbidden and will lead to disqualification.\nAll works must be completed and submitted before midnight on the final day of the contest. The board will be locked after that time.\nEntrants may either work solo, or in teams of two people. Any more than two will result in disqualification.\n\nEntering:\n\nYou may enter any time during the contest, but you must submit your name before you begin work. You must create an entry under the Entry & Submission Board. Your entry post must be properly formatted as shown in the How To Enter sticky thread.\nTo submit your map, you will need to attach an image to your entry post prior the end of the contest, and a link to the map. Look for the modify button!\nUse the hyperlink button provided (the globe with a file icon) and the picture button (the icon of a picture) to set up a link and attach an image. Mediafire is a preferable upload site. The forum supports attachments, but none larger than 1024KB.\n\nExample: [url]www.myupload.com[/url] and [img]image-url[/img]\n\nWhat you have to do:\n\nWhat you make from the template is up to you, so long as the general layout remains intact.\nYou may detail to your heart's content, to any theme you wish. Your final entry should be complete, with finished geometry, texturing, and lighting.\nContestants are more or less limited to textures and models included with Sauerbraten with the minor exceptions of a small number of theme specific textures. Custom content as a whole should be avoided for this contest, but a very small amount of theme specific items are allowed; or one or two theme specific textures, for example. Custom skyboxes are allowed.\nFor the most part, we would like to see what you can do with what you have, but don't want to limit your creativity if something is absolutely needed.\n\nFinal Notes:\n\nIf you intend on participating, go ahead and make an Entry post. It does not hurt to throw your name in before it starts.\nThe template map will be released on the day of the contest. You will have 7 days to work on your entry.\nIf you have any problems or questions, feel free to ask in the Questions Thread\n\nFinal entries will be judged and the top five will be picked. A post containing images of the top maps and download links will be made at the end of the contest, with a poll for rating each one.\n\nHave fun!\n\nImportant:\n\nFor those who do not want to, or cannot make an account on the contest forum, you can email your entry and final submission to:\n\nquadropoliscontest@gmail.com\n\nI will transfer all necessary information to the forum personally.\n\n‹ New game \"Humanity Pending\" does Red eclipse load .ogz? ›\n\nRating\n6\npoints\n (6 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\ncontesttemplate.zip\t87.43 KB\nlogin to post comments",

I decided to join this forum to inform the Cube 2 community that we are using the Cube 2 engine to create a game called Humanity Pending. Before anyone questions the legitimacy of this I will tell you its real and you can check out our Indie DB page here: http://www.indiedb.com/games/humanitypending. This is however a closed source, commercial game. It will not be released for a while, However I figured we should tell you now because it would be really great to have community support.

Once that release has been made, maps could be made for the game by those who are interested. Until then, please try out the game(svn is the best way to go), and post any comments, ideas, or suggestions you have. Any comments are nice, but try to be specific, saying that everything needs improvement(or that it sucks) is too general.\n*(forum link provided below)\n\nHave fun! ;)\n\nIron Fist is an experimental single-player/multi-player first-person shooter, built as a hybrid of Blood Frontier(now Red Eclipse), and is a conversion of the Cube Engine 2 (Sauerbraten). It is simply a conceptual production and is a product of trial and error. Move fast and try to aim as best as you can!\n\nArcade gameplay, Realistic graphics! During the development of Iron Fist, the concept of the project has changed severely from its original concept, the story line changing to fit the game, embodying an arcade feel coupled along side realistic graphics. As the game matured, and more was achievable, it turned around and the game began to conform to the story. As the two begin to balance out, it will be quite interesting where the development will lead to next.\n\nIron Fist is completely open source and free to use. The concept of the game, however, such as the story, is not open source. Otherwise Iron Fist is strict on maintaining an open source policy. Nonetheless, take caution and make sure to read the readmes when required.\n\nIf you are interested in development, want to become a part of Iron Fist, or require technical support please email Cure Productions at cureproductions@live.com.\n\n========Project Downloads============\n/* you MUST download all patches for the game(in their respected categories) to work correctly */\n/* the patches fix bugs and various other issues in Iron Fist */\n\nPre-Alpha:\nIron Fist (Ver - 1.3.5)\nIron Fist Patch (Ver - 1.3.6)\nIron Fist Patch (Ver - 1.3.7)\n\nOther:\nProject SVN\nProject Forums\n\nURL http://www.wix.com/l_tempris/ironfistcube2\nRating\n21\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Put it in your main sauerbraten folder, then add this line to your autoexec:\nexec coloredmaptitle.cfg\nand save. When you start up Sauerbraten the next time you should get a message about the color GUI being successfully installed.\n\nWith F8 you can call up a small window. With that you can make colored maptitles. It is somewhat easy to use, at least way easier than all those control-shift or control-alt combinations or however that worked...\nIn case you are really totally lost, there is a long description in the window self.\n\nIn addition does it include some new variables. These are mostly for command-line usage. Those codes like ^f3 (which are used to color strings) don't work when you type them directly ingame. The variables I mentioned are containing exactly those codes, what makes it possible to use them directly ingame.

It is made to be used during duels and has several different features:\n\nContinuous Echo: Will continuously echo whether you are winning/losing/tied and the score difference (optional) at a user-selected interval.\n\nKey-bound Echo: Single-echo version of what was described above, echos upon the press of a user-defined key.\n\nDuel Gamehud: Shows what was described above in the gamehud, along with the time left in a game (optional).\n\nThese functions can be individually enabled/disabled based on the users preferences. In addition to this, the script comes with a normal gamehud (modification of srbs's stats script; link to it at bottom) showing name, frags, deaths, acc, kpd, flags and timeleft; any one of these can be shown/hidden. The script also has an auto-start feature (can be turned off if the user wishes) that will start the script during duels automatically.\n\nThe gui is currently bound to key 'L', feel free to change this.\n\nsrbs's stats script: http://quadropolis.us/node/2818\nNote: This script includes srbs's stats script so you do not need to download/exec it.\n\nChanges/Updates:\n(1/18/2011) v1.1: Colors of the duel stats are now customizable.\n(1/27/2011) v1.2: Colors of the normal gamehud are now customizable.\n(1/29/2011) v1.3: Condensed color GUIs and got rid of purple GUI tabs (they were kind of obnoxious to be honest).\n(2/11/2011) v1.4: Made certain aspects of the GUI more elaborate. The 'echo on keystroke' now echos your normal stats if the script is off (i.e. you're not in a duel). Added some more info to the 'about' tab and a few other small useful updates.\n(2/12/2011) v1.5: Added the ability to include normal stats in the duel gamehud, many people said they wanted to see their accuracy during duels and now you can by simply checking the corresponding checkbox.\n(9/16/2011) v1.6: Minor optimizations, arranged the elements of the GUI in a more logical fashion.\n\nConfig file duel.cfg (6.27 KB)\nRating\n48\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Added pink flowers/roses whatever you want to call them.\n2.) Did some more experimenting, found out that its impossible to blend two grass texture together, however, it can still be blended with other tetures. so I recomend patching up several different grasses (make sure they dont touch) and then blend them with a common texture.\n3.)

(surely not as a good player ;-)). But there is one thing i would like you to know: As i registered on www.nooblounge.net, i found friends on mumble. We did a little community, to build maps and released them on a server, held by the founder of nooblounge. You can download this mappackage from \"maplounge\", which is a site on www.nooblounge.net. But the point is: as i found out, there are much more talented mappers out there, than we are. And we would like to invite you, to publish your maps on a server, where only maps are played, that are not yet content of sauerbraten. I do commit, that i downloaded the mappackage from www.quadmapserver.com, so i know that you already have realised an idea like this, but do not follow to it anymore. Maybe you could give us the permission to use your great maps (as i have seen them on quadmapserver or here on this site), and the better it would be to see you playing on maploungeserver, which you can reach on: /connect nooblounge.net 11110. I hope you are interested and would appreciate if you send me: \"nothing\" a private message on www.nooblounge.net. After this i will contact you to see, if we find an agreement.

I was wondering if there were anyway to create a changing lightmap for the map. I know that you can deposit the light maps into a set of .bmps, and I was wodering if there was a command that I could use in the .cfg that would allow me to switch between two different lightmaps to creat this effect.

Meant to show off its engine.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (77KB)\nDetailed description\n\nWARNING: 981k wtr very heavy lights and detail.\n\nThis is my project to create a tech demo for cube2. Started about 2-3 months ago with many technical issues along the way. Most of which were finding out where sauerbraten saved the map file. Even though sauerbraten loaded the map just fine, I could never find it. Same went for the sound files. Even though I placed them in the sounds folder, sauerbraten moved them to another folder which was difficult to find.\n\nThere will be more updates on this. The next hopefuly will be blending the flowers (time consuming because of lights) which Ive asked snowy to do for me because my laptop is lacking a number pad.\n\nSnowy has helped me a good deal with lowering wtr. It was at 1337k wtr which made it extremly difficult to edit. calcing was also made easier after wtr reduction and other modifications. Takes me a good half hour to calc on 2 cores.\n\nThere are some light errors in the banisters, for now that is the only way I have found to do the banisters geometricaly so that there is no seams or excesive stretching. However I will do some more experimenting if I have time.\n\nThis map introduces some new concepts. One for example is using particles to represent leaves/pedals flowing in the wind. The particles arent doing my idea justice but they are close enough, just use your imagination. Also, what uses alot of wtr is the leaves/pedals on the ground. These are necessary to tie in the theme of the map.\n\nIve cut corners in non-important areas, like the floor of the water. It hasnt been editing terrain wise And I dont plan on changing that to save wtr.\n\nThe islands arent meant to be anything but looks. However I did add a ladder so that the could be accessed.\n\nWhy so many lights? well... I tried to take some out, but it just doesnt feel the same. Why add lights in the day time? Its not daytime its sunrise, therefore, the lights have not turned off just yet.\n\nIf you have any recomendations please let me know. I will be working on this untill I am 100% satisfied. If you have information on how to show off sauerbratens engine anymore than I already have, please let me know.\n\nMap file TechDemo.zip (3.53 MB)\nRating\n51\npoints\n (7 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "Suicizer | 2011-03-03 10:56",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Help and Support\n\nInformation\nBecause it seems to be pretty tough for people to create models from basic geometry in Sauerbraten, here are some steps to create your own models!\n\nI'm considering you already know how to create a map inside Sauerbraten, so I won't put anything about that in the tutorial.\nI'm also considering you're using the windows version of Sauerbraten, installed on it's default way. So do me a favour and don't ask about how to create a model using mac, linux, or any other OS.\n\n1. First start up Sauerbraten on your regular way.\n\n\n2. Press /newmap when your able to, after Sauerbraten loaded all files, etc.\n\n\n3. Create some basic geometry, like a simple cube (just as test).\n\n\n4. Delete any other geometry that's inside the map, except that cube.\n\n\n5. Press /writeobj cube. After you did that, an .obj-file and a .mtl-file will be written by Sauerbraten in it's main-folder (called cube)\n\n\n6. Quit Sauerbraten or just go \"out-game\" and move to the models folder which is in the packages folder.\n\n\n7. Create a new folder inside the models folder, called cubic.\n\n\n8. Move to the main Sauerbraten folder and copy the .obj-file and .mtl-file (which are named cube).\n\n9. Paste both files (the .obj-file and the .mtl-file) inside the cubic folder, which you just created some steps ago.\n\n\n10. Create the required configuration-file for the model (obj.cfg) by using notepad (or any other program you prefer). I'll attach my \"prefab\" for an .obj-file which takes only 1 texture (no bump-, spec- or glowmaps attached, just for simplicity) on this content.\n\n\n11. Create your own texture (or just use already existing textures, like I did).\n\n12. Start up Sauerbraten or go \"ingame\" again.\n\n\n13. Press /newmap again and go into edit-mode.\n\n\n14. Press /mmodel cubic\n\n15. Press /newent mapmodel 170\n\n16. Watch your own created model!\n\n\nNotifications\nThere are some limitations for .obj-files in Sauerbraten as:\n- You can attach several textures to an .obj-file (exclusive the bump-mapped texture and masks), as their textureslots are being signed as a group of surfaces that carry the same texture. Due this, they can be called up when specifying the right slot and assigning a texture to that slot.\n\nThe .mtl-file preserves the textures and their paths that can't be loaded within Sauerbraten, but they can by other modeling programs. That's why it's recommended not to throw it away.\n\n- You can't link several meshes together like a .md3-file or an .md5-file does (neither by using the configuration file of the model). You can only \"link\" them manually by positioning both models on a certain position so they looked linked together.\n\n- You can't load a separate glow- or specular-mapped texture (neither for a .md2 .md3 or .md5-file), so glow- and specular-mapped texture should be 1 file (called commonly \"masks\"). Height-mapped textures aren't being supported at all, for any model format.\n\n- If you have changed certain commands in the model's configuration file), it won't load the changes until you have restarted Sauerbraten entirely (so don't start up your map again, it won't have effect in some situations).\n\n- Animations aren't supported on .obj-files (unlike .md2 .md3 and .md5). However, texture-animation should still be loaded (as by ojbscroll or objglow).\n\nP.S.\nGrammar and spelling will be updated! I'll also try to add images (if I know how) on each step...\n\nImprovements\n3th of March 2011\n- Images has been added to the content. Click on the number of the step to view the image.\n- I've attached my own cube (with \"prefab\" cfg) to this content, so if you still have any problems, download it and observe it's configuration file.\n\n11th of October 2011\n- An animation that has been copied from the rocket-hudgun which is in the assassin- and ctf-edition and pasted into the prefab.cfg (skinscroll and water-animation). I haven't been able yet to make it work by using an .obj-file, but maybe you can?\n- Updated spelling.\n- Updated the obj.cfg of the model.\n\n29th of July 2012\nChanged the layout of the content and swept up some statements which were not clear or untrue.\n\n‹ Red Eclipse Windows server tutorial Top-down camera ›\n\nRating\n27\npoints\n (3 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\ncubic_obj_tutorial_11oct11.zip\t9.8 KB\nlogin to post comments",

Well now we need your help, we figured that if we needed people who know the Cube 2 engine well that this would be where to find them. Well we've been working with adding an experimental dynamic area lighting system, it uses the exact same dynamic lights that are already implemented in the engine for muzzle flashes and explosions, the only difference is that we are using an entity that emits a dynamic light that any editor can place as if it were a one of the default cube 2 lights. Our approach works perfectly if we only use one light but as soon as we add more than one then only half of them render and a few render half of a light and sometimes everything turns green, this is demonstrated in the picture above. Our question is: Does anybody know why this is happening or how we could fix it?. If you are wondering why we want dynamic lighting, its so that we can take advantage of Cube 2s real-time terrain deformation.\n\n-fisttech\n\n‹ Red Eclipse - Custom server maps Red Eclipse Anaglyph? ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nscreenshot_43502.png\t1000.43 KB\nlogin to post comments",

I got a few good comments, I don't know if the map was ever really played online that much or not. After the release of Red Eclipse, I began seeing how Superrunning might work for the mod, so I imported it, fixed some mistakes, retextured it, and put in support for most gamemodes. I say most, because I haven't really tested them all out. However, it should work the way I think it will. (EDIT: I've been messing around with CTF- I think I'll have to seriously reconsider object placement.) This is currently an alpha stage product, so not everything is concrete, and I really need comments and feedback about it in order to improve it. Red Eclipse doesn't have much documentation right now, so I was unaware of how to do a fair few things.\nThis is a small, confined map at first glance. Once you know your way around, you might not think that way anymore. The warning is that if you don't like small maps, you definitely will not like this one. Not much of the overall map has changed since the Sauerbraten edition. Hopefully what I did change was for the better.\nNot sure how to package this map file since it goes in the My Documents folder for me.\n\nMap file superrunningmkii.zip (2.09 MB)\nRating\n1\n point\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

With this optional argument you can coerce the command to start a clanwar, regardless of master / admin state.\n\nThe script checks at the start, if you are master / admin, if the syntax is correct, and if there are enough players for each clan.

It is absolutely chock full of deadly particles such as lasers, and is the result of MUCH hard work. We would like some constructive feedback on this, as it is our first major map that is actually playable. Works with any gamemode, although it works GREAT with jetpack mode.\n\nThis map is still in it's preliminary testing and constructive criticism is encouraged. Feel free to tell us how to improve it.\n\nUpdate notes as of 5/19/2011:\n\nEnlarged main platform, now complete with corner pathways and glass floors\nCreated a launcher from the omega base that places you on the main platform\nMade it slightly easier to traverse the meteors via non-jetpack\n\nDeveloper Notes:\n\n- The map requires a semi decent computer to run the particle effects. Primitive systems beware!\n- Watch where you're going. Treat the lasers like walls that can't be walked on.\n- It's quite easy for the blue team to get themselves to the red base. If you time it right and patiently, you can slip between the wide cracks at certain points in the lasers.\n- If the bot members of your team are being stupid and running themselves into lasers, show them how to use the launchers and such. They do actually learn from you.\n- Don't be afraid to make sacrifices. There are certain areas that can be accessed, but are very hard to get out of.

Thanks to Fatum for helping with weapons/playerstarts/advicing and soilah for helping with waypoints.\n\nUpdate 16 july 2011\n* deleted 4 useless lights\n* reduced WTR\n\nUpdate 14 july 2011\n* fixed the cfg file\n* rebuilt the corners buildings and added 4 teleports, now the side paths are shorter and faster\n* added a new glass/windows texture\n* added a new grass and daisies texture\n* fixed the lighting\n* fixed waypoints\n\nMap file asgard_v1.3.zip (8.48 MB)\nRating\n116\npoints\n (14 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Final Release | Deathmatch | Capture | Large (9-15) | Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND)\nBlurb Suicizer's Cube Engine Deathmatch Map 5\nScreenshot \nGet original file (562KB)\nDetailed description\n\nHere it is, my \"Quad Map Contest\" entry-map.\n\nScedm5 has a unique gameplay and flow, wich also counts for the theme (which is \"wet-old-castle\"). It's designed you can navigate smoothly and pretty fast trough the map (that's why those teleports and jumppads exist), while your still able to get those necessary frags.\nIt is the most playable on deathmatch with an amount of players between 8 and 16, but also (insta-/efficiency-)hold or (regen)capture can be played on it.\n\nNow about the name...\nWhy such name?\nSince it's the 5th map which carries the \"scedm\" in it's name and I couldn't find any other name than such, because I wasn't sure of the theme yet when I started the map (I was thinking it would be castle-themed, but unlike other maps, way different. Think about \"The House of Decay\" in QuakeLive.\nI'm not sure if it really will be this theme, since it has way smaller hall- and doorways.\nMy backup plan for that was to take a similar theme as \"Black Cathedral\" in Quake Live.\nWhy? Since it also has huge rooms and a similar flow (even tough in scedm5 it's a bit smaller and more narrow)).\n\nOn 16-4-2011:\nHere are my plans for the next 2 weeks:\n\n- Create the basic geometry of the map.\n- Add gameplay to the map.\n- Think even more about what theme it should be.\n- Make a \"sketch\" of a config-file for the map.\n\nI hope this is enough info!\n\nP.S.\nI'm not sure if this map will be 1 of my best maps, since the matter of time and the limited engine were building on. I think my layout won't be that kick-ass as I thought, since curves have a very limited shape in cube engine 2. Probably if I would make it with an other radiant (like gtkradiant) I would get a better result, since you edit the vertex on there, not a polygon (so you change a point of a shape, not like in cube engine 2, a plane/surface).\nI'll still try anyways...\n\nImprovements:\n\n19-4-2011\nCreated an original jumppad system to add more flow to the map and to replace the odd stairs at the south-side of the map (wich is at the other side of the screenshot)...\n\nNo-one can tell me this map won't be original :P.\n\n20-4-2011\nMade the gameplay and flow more proper. It should be sort of stable now. Some details has been added (still untextured of course).\nThe map is downloadable now!\n\n21-4-2011\nIncreased the gameplay and flow. Decreased the size of the halls by adding different heights of platforms in it (check out the screenshots of 21-4-2011).\nAdded/changed position of playerstarts, teledest 3 and changed the position of several pickups.\nAdded some more geometry.\n\n22-4-2011\nStarted with lighting and (and a bit theming)\nLocked the gameplay and flow, it probably won't have much changes anymore, at least not huge...\n\n24-4-2011\nImproved and increased the geometry for lighting.\n\n27-4-2011\nChanged the gameplay a bit, turned the diagonal catwalk into stairs that you won't get slowed down anymore after taking the jumpadcurve. Changed the jumppadramp at the other side of the map (the \"lowest\" platform). Also did some improvements on the geometry for lighting.\n\n28-4-2011\nAdded a structure above the \"circle\" with the YA and above the area with the teleport that's leading to the jumppadcurves.\n\n5-5-2011\nAdded the basic layout for lighting. Probably won't stay the same.\nPicking textures for the map. It probably will be a more \"wet\" castle theme, which the \"gor\" textures.\nChanged the gameplay and flow a bit. Added several details where you can jump on and continue your journey trough the map easier/faster.\nCleaned up the config-file of the map. Still can have some more cleaning (especially the mapmodels) but so far so good.\n\n9-5-2011\nIncreased the texturing. Like 2/3 of the map is textured now. The lighting has been changed so it's less bright (which gives a better effect).\nDetails still have to be added some more.\n\n10-5-2011\nIncreased the texturing and added some detail (like trimmings). Also added water in the jumpcurve.\nI was thinking about adding waypoints, but I'm pretty sure the bots won't be able to get the point why the jumpcurve exists and how to use it (will fail to reach the other sides because they aren't holding the forward-key all the time).\n\n11-5-2011\nIncreased the texturing and added some detail again. Also made textures fit the geometry more.\n\n12-5-2011\nFinaly done with texturing. There are still some areas to improve, but everything is textured right now.\nLighting still needs a review tough (and some details still need to be added).\n\n16-5-2011\nI did it! I managed to \"finish\" a map in time! Of course it can be improved a lot more (and it will), like the lighting still needs a review, detailing still can be better, etc. But for now, I'm happy that I managed to get the map done in time.\nAdded the envmap textures, cleaned up the map-configuration file, added more mapmodels, more detail, etc.\n\n17-5-2011\nReplace the heightmap-textures of the costum envmap-textures wich are for the teleports for specular maps, to give a more \"painting\" feeling.\nI would like that this technique of showing where your getting telespawned, isn't getting copied by other mappers in Cube Engine 2.\nPlease understand that.\nAdded a loading-screenshot, waypoints (wich won't get loaded, but that's because there are no waypoints. The only reason it exists because this is 1 of the requirements in the contest) licenses of mapmodels, etc.\n\n21-5-2011\nChanged the colour of several textures and replaced some of them (like the ugly green brick ceiling). Fixed some model issues and decreased the file-size of the zip a lot (like 4,5mb less).\nAdded sounds to the map. Deleted the \"cubic\" model, since it isn't giving any more worth to the map at all (and the skins were kind of buggy somehow). Only need to add waypoints and then it's probably the final release!\n\n23-5-2011\nWith this update, I almost came to an end on this map. There isn't much left to improve. Waypoints and sounds are added, gameplay has been rechecked and I've added more pickups so people won't have to pistol fight all the time (but still being hungry for health, armour and ammo). The file-size has been increased slightly because of the costum sound of viruz (wich is getting used in Red Eclipse and yes, I've asked Quin if I can use it). The bots aren't smart in the map, like I already tought. But ah well, at least it got waypoints.\nFixed some texture issues and tried to get lost of the nasty lighterror, but failed (too bad).\n\n30-5-2011\nReplaced the teleport to the \"side-ring\" of the center, for a jumppad with some kind of hallway. Because of that, the flow and gameplay should be better, since it adds another \"fragtrick\" to the various tricklist in the map.\nI've updated the waypoints of course.\nAlso replaced the ugly green texture on the ceiling where the old teleport was positioned for a way better texture, check out now!\nI've converted all teleport-textures into .jpg format instead of .png, since it drops the file size a lot (it's about 12,75mb now, while previously it was 15,1mb).\nI've repositioned the lighting of the sewer (as well as a mapmodel).\nIn the second release on this day, the ugly stairs has been replaced for a box (I know, would have seen it on a different way but ah well, there are limitations) and another way to the centre of the sewer has been added.\nAlso fixed a critical waypoints mistake.\nAs experiment, I've added bases for the mode hold and capture, but the primary mode of this map should stay deathmatch. It seems to be pretty nice, playing hold on it, since you have to keep moving constantly (like using teleports, jumppads, etc). You also needs some cover of your teammates if you can't make it.\n\n1-6-2011\nTook some advice of Jorge and created another way to get out of the water (wich is in the sewer). Also repositioned the bases and added some more waypoints. Bases are from now on also named.\nThe bases seems to be more balanced now and it makes the map pretty fun to play in capture, as long as your playing with an ammount between 8 and 16 players. Too less, you won't find much fragging at all. Too much, it's pure choas and you get the effect wich happens on the map \"hades\", lots of people spend more time on dieing that really capturing and fragging.\nI only need to fix the 2 \"broken\" edges. After that, the map should be done (if nothing else will get reported, since I don't see any mistake/misstep anymore).\n\n5-6-2011\nI finally improved those broken edges. To me, they look way better now and they make the 2nd floor way more accessible. If you time right (and are running in the right direction), you only have to do 1 single jump on the main floor to the 2nd floor.\nWaypoints updated of course.\nFixed some trimmings and texture mistakes.\nUpdated the costum teleport textures, since they were outdated again.\nFixed some geometry mistakes inside walls. They should be without again.\n\nThis probably was the final and last update, since I really don't see anything else to be updated.\n\n7-6-2011\nReplaced the evil8 textures for the \"glue2\" texture of lunaran. This fits more to the theme and saves some file-size. Also replaced the big jumppads in the sewer for a more elegant structure.\nAlso converted every skin in the \"sitters\" folder to .jpg-files, to reduce the file-size.\nFinally managed to get the map under the 10Mb of file-size!\n\n11-6-2011\nI've reviewed the clipping/noclipping and improved it. Players shouldn't be able to look trough walls anymore by noclip material.\nSome models are also updated, like specularity-maps has been deleted (Sauerbraten has an \"ingame specmap\" anways, so no custom specmaps needed). Bump-map's also have been deleted or been converted to .jpg files to save some more file-size.\nOddly, the file-size of the map went higher after clipping (maybe I didn't used \"calclight 1\" in the previous version?).\nI really don't see much more to improve and I think to close the project, as long as no one else than me has more ideas about improving it.\n\n5-7-2011\nFixed some mistakes in the configuration files of the models.\n\nIf you still have anything which you think this map needs or could be better, tell me now.\n\nEnjoy it!\n\nP.S.\nComments with constructive critique is welcome!\n\nMost information which stands here is also viewable on the contest website which is here.\n\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?cmc17rzhb6gvrc6\nRating\n94\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Below are the details for sauerbraten.\n\nBoostpads define the amount of speed simply in a measurement of m/s.\nFirst argument defines the speed.\nBoostpads define whether the speed is added to the current momentum or simply give the player the specified amount of speed.\n\nSecond argument defines this property.\n\nBoostpads would allow the user to select if they will individually use a sound or not.\nThird argument defines the usage of entity sound.\n\nSo, people, discuss, suggest and support, for we may (if we're lucky enough) get a new feature in the release underway!

Just import the map into the maps folder and start up the game. Although I tried that, I found a problem. Blood Frontier used map files known as BGZs, instead of the MPZs Red Eclipse uses. Red Eclipse is supposed to be able to open these, but for some reason, all I get is a blank map. When I change the extension of the file to MPZ by renaming it, the game attempts to load the map, but then crashes and gives me \"Fatal Signal 11, Segmentation Violation\".\n\nI've tried many things to open it, and it fails to open, giving me one of these two errors.

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nOk, so basically, this new node is about grouping together people's requests and expectations of the new version. Those may include fixes, additions, feature tweaks or outright removal of content, for whatever reason. All you have to do is keep it logical, and the idea will be added to the board along with a reason as to why it should be done.\n\nIf any one you has a question about a specific entry, ask directly. Just make sure the same thing has not been answered before to avoid clutter.\n\nGraphical Adjustments\nA fix for the selection gridlines appearing over game menus. Really annoying when browsing textures.\n[UNLIKELY] Better alpha material support which allows for consecutive alpha elements to be seen behind each other instead of disappearing altogether.\nBetter fog execution that makes transitioning from arid to condensed smoothly and less block-like. In simpler words, the fog shouldn't rotate when the player turns, and the smoothness should be configurable.\nThe fog should hide the geometry backed on the skybox in the distance instead of just fade it with the fog color.\nA fix for the water caustics appearing on geometry that isn't in contact with the water material (or anywhere near it) when the player is in the water.\nA fix for the materials always being above generated grass, resulting in weird results.\n[UNLIKELY] A fix for the water randomly tearing apart when in contact with the skybox edges.\n[UNLIKELY] A fix for the skybox's lower part tearing apart when a viewer is off the map's limits.\nGameplay Adjustments\n[DONE] Allowing the teamkiller to pick up the flag. Accidents happen, especially in efficiency.\nReturn the flag to the base when it hits the bottom of the map or enters gameclip (by falling in it).\nBase the scoring of efficiency gamemodes on damage dealt (minus the damage done to teammates) to enemies rather than frags to compensate for unfair scoring. Doing so will make people more competitive so as to deal as much damage as possible, engaging in group tactics more often (or exploiting AOE weapons even more than before).\nEditor Adjustments\n[UNLIKELY] Ability to bend materials the same way geometry is bent. That will desire a lot of rewiring since editing materials will have to be done outside the geometry's world.\n[UNLIKELY] Multiple editing planes? There are cases that some things just can't be created with the octree, but if two different things are combined together on the same space, unique shapes can be formed without hacking cube corners around.\nSeparation of rotation and flip commands to allow both rotation and flipping of textures instead of just one of the two (see vrotate).\n[DONE] Ability to specify jumppad/teleport etc sounds in map configs for added variety.\n[UNLIKELY] New material named Damage that allows for customization through vdamage. The material should at least have the option to define the damage to be dealt within a second, transitioning smoothly and using a continuous damage screen with no damage compass.\nFull 3D rotation support for models in real-time. What more can one say about it?\nCubescript Related\nHover support. Addition of commands 'onhover' and 'onhoveronce' to allow for cubescript to be executed continuously or once when the cursor hovers over GUI items that can be interacted with, like buttons and radios.\n[DONE] More global variables. For example $recdemo and $recmov.\nAdditions/Removals/Replacements\nGame updater to avoid the need to redownload the whole game and reinstall each time a \"version\" is out. People will be able to play with the latest sets of updates and participate in beta packages if they want to.\nMore crosshairs of higher quality.\n[DONE] Server-side option to allow or disallow dealing damage to teammates\nMore demo control functions.\nAddition of more game soundtracks. 8 tracks repeating randomly all the time really get boring after some time.\n[DONE] Replacement of the gun sounds with newer ones.\n[LIKELY] Replacement of the announcer voice with a better one.\nUnderwater sound effects for swimming, gunfire and ambience.\nAddition of a special underwater screen, similar to the damage screen, along with a screen blur to simulate the environment better.\nMisc\n[DONE] Ability to sort the server on the server browser at will and perhaps the ability to disable their \"constant updating\".\nPersonal Messages would be nice. Perhaps specifying multiple people would be a good idea as well.\n‹ What did you ask @ Santa? How to name bases in Custom maps ›\n\nRating\n54\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

InstaCTF is pretty hardcore here, it have some umbeivable long shots and there are some minor tricks.\n\nIt have 9 bases, quite temporally, and, of couse, it works better for a multyteam macht than for a standard 3vs3.\n\nPlacement of items and playerstarts is temporanly and there is, probably, too much healt in the center. Suggestion are appreciated.\n\nAlso lighting is far from complete. And i hope its clipped well enough. Is not my usual to make so heavvy maps, and i would like to optimize it, could someone advice me about how to do it?\n\nAt the least it should be 100% playable, if you have a nice computer, in each mode. Happy fragging!!!\n\nI have forgot to thanks lots of people wich suggested me from the first layout to this post, and make it possible:\nAt6, for some details, and decors on the map.\nZooka, for some layouts inprovements.\n\nAll the ICC clan, for suggestion and testing the layout.\n\nThe one wich made the basic shape of the couple... you are great.\n\nMeister for suggesting a good lighting (and others things...)\n\n\nUPDATE -1:\n\nOk, i have failed at simplyfy the map, now is 200k :D\nI haven't removed the particles, but add some to ensure also nice macine can exspect some lag XD - not seriusly i need an excluse for some clip/death. I haven't texured the map more, or removed the cubes for ammo. I don't know if this fixes can greatly improve performances, they will be consider in a future update. I haven't clip the pipes, i like how they are, you need a bit of train to maximize the speed and stability i like the fact that some tricks, can be hard to do. What i have done in randoms way is:\n\nThe under spikes are half size the original\nBetter clip in the upper base\nNew skylight, and relatives ones...\nSome details finished\nRemoved some healt from the centrer and added an MG and GR\nRemoved the stairs near the jump - the jumps works enought\nRemoved the teleport holes, i wasn't happy with them.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Alpha | Public Domain\nBlurb From old hudguns...\nScreenshot \nGet original file (348KB)\nDetailed description\n\nAfter I was experimenting with the shadersettings of the old hudguns included in assassin- and ctf-edition, I came up with the idea, why such shaders couldn't be used for textures?\nSo I tried to have the same settings for shaders on a normal texture (like caustics, water).\nThe effect seems to be even better than I thought, because it allows a separate moving copy of the texture.\n\nNotifications of the version posted on the 26th of June 2011;\nI don't know how it exactly works, because I'm pretty bad at scripting especially when it's not even cubescript.\nI only know \"MAD\" is about the colour of the texture.\n\nAfter some experimenting by combining shaders, I noticed such thing is not possible. So it can't be combined with any other shader (as far as I'm aware off, but please try it yourself and if you made any progress, please post a comment about it).\nThe shader also won't work if hudguns aren't showed (so like in edit mode). This is probably because it was used as shaders for hudguns only.\nThere seems to be an odd bug, which makes the texture stop scrolling when any scrolling texture gets hit by an explosive (like rockets or grenades), but continues after wards. Oddly, when covering the surface with alpha material, this bug won't occur.\nAfter some experimenting with filling cubes with water while there also is a texture which carries those shaders in that cube, I've noticed that it seems like the shaders carry the same code as caustics do.\n\nLike the demonstration map is showing, there could be made water with which do has geometry in it.\nAnother nice example in the demonstration map is animated caustics, which could be used very well for teleports or as a \"field of energy\".\nA constantly changing gab into a white face could create sweet situations when used for gameplay to look trough a wall or a floor (when using blendmapping for example).\nMy last example is a \"waving\" animation by using the rocketpsource setting with 1 of the square brushes. Probably quite useful for letting a flag or something similar to that really \"wave by the wind\".\n\nNotifications of the version on 1st July 2011;\nAfter changing some stuff into the script, I noticed that \"program.env[6]\" isn't as buggy as \"program.env[5]\". So I recommend to use \"program.env[6]\" instead of the other previous one.\nExplanation about some settings (like scrolling) is inside the configuration-file.\nThe command \"vscroll\" won't work on those textures, because the texture is getting scrolled in it's shaders already (shouldn't be a big problem, would it?).\n\nI've added a way better demonstration map (still not font of it, but it fills it's purpose way better than the previous one).\n\nIf you know more about how these shaders are working, please don't be afraid and post a comment about it right here!\n\nThanks to geartrooper for making those awesome hudguns used in assassin- and ctf-edition!\n\nP.S.\nThis is the code to do so:\nshader 0 causticsworld1 [\n@vpstart\nPARAM seconds = program.env[6]; //Seems to change wich program it is running.

This is just because models have a larger amount of commands which most of them have a different way to specify (like md3spec mesh 30 for example.

This should make it easier to understand all parameters of certain commands as several of them have parameters with completely different purposes or cases which should be explained.\n\nCube Engine 2 supports more formats than the guide offers. Those have equal options to the .md5-format or .md3-format. These are;\n\n.iqm (Inter-Quake Model), equal to the .md5-format.\n.smd (Studiomdl Data), equal to the .md5-format.\n.obj, equal to .md3-format (objlink and objanim are not supported).\n\nJust replace the md3* or md5* to execute the commands.\n\nImprovements\n28th of June 2011\nReviewed the prefabs and added \"unknown\" commands.\n\n17th of November 2011\nRewrote the prefabs to get a cleaner result for explaining every parameter of every command.\nDeleted the prefabs of the \"iqm\", \"smd\" and \"obj\" formats, as they are identical to the \"md3\" and \"md5\" prefab.\n\n18th of November 2011\nWiped out some typos and added more information about commands which affect the lighting of the model.\n\n22th of October 2012\nFixed some small mistake which I've overseen.\n\nConfig file config_prefab_19july13.zip (11.17 KB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

However, as both cities grew, they took more and more energy, until war was declared. Will your city drive the other from the station before the generators break down from the strain?\n\nThis map was a lot of fun to make. It was based partly off of M.C. Esher's Impossible Cube, but I added more paths to the layout including a passageway encircling the map, a walkway that provides a quick path from one flag to the other but is devoid of any items or cover, and a control room for each team that is protected by one-way energy gateways.\n\nThis map was also an excercise in the \"vtex\" commands, which I hadn't really used that much before.\n\nThere are still some minor problems. I can't get the lightning around the generator to be seamless on all 4 sides, and I can't really get the lighting effects I want without /blurlms 2 and /blurskylight 2, which cause some faint lines that shouldn't be there. In any case, criticism is welcome, and this map I fully intend to make as good as I can.\n\nUPDATED JULY 7:\n-Removed part of the top platform and replaced it with burning wires. It's still possible to get across, but it's harder. The minimap now shows an S for Sauerbraten.\n-deleted some of the jumppads so players have to take the long way over the top\n-improved jumppads- they are now fully visible and fit the texture\n-added a ramp that goes from the ground to the top platform so people on the ground aren't just stuck.\n-curved most ramps in the center\n-made pickups less concentrated in the center\n-added trim and detailed textures to hallways\n-made geometry around \"ceil1a\" texture fit the texture, and changed the decor. (It now looks kind of like a futuristic jukebox.)\n-added lots of boxes for cover, and more ammo, to the flat hallway along the outside. Now players will have incentive to go there even in insta.\n-added a flag room that's level with the first floor\n-removed \"trak5/tile3e.jpg\" texture on diagonal surfaces.\n-replaced texture in long slanted hallway\n-added shadows\n-changed water color from murky polluted green to fluorescent toxic green\n-added intricate tangle of pipes in water\n-added a death boundary outside of the map (If you cross it, your city's Command will activate your implanted cyanide pill).\n-made pulsating textures less bright\n\nMap file overdrive.zip (6.44 MB)\nRating\n15\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

After a small amount of time, I bumped into this website and found just what I needed.\n\nI converted them to .jpg file (so I actually haven't modified the texture itself) to save up file-size (decreased the total size more than 2 times it's original size) and to make it more efficient to work with.\n\nI hope this makes those old textures back in the running again.

To me, it gives a better nice result as without all those other textures.\nUpdated the configuration file and added 2 of them; 1 for just the \"new\" textures only and another one with also the already included textures, but bump-, parallax- and specular mapped instead (as they weren't on default).\nAlso placed the folder inside the \"textures\" folder, just like Razgriz told me so.\n\n7 August 2011\nAdded the necessary map into the texture pack and used .pk3 instead of .zip (because the license says so).\n\nAdvertising\nHere are some other texture packs which you might be interested in:\n\nMap file use_download_link_please!.txt (29 bytes)\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?sa4n1uw3pgtp434\nRating\n20\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I probably could have and should have released this map a year ago or more, as it was practically done except for the basements. At the time, I felt it was still lacking something, so I added the basements. First there were only two basements, one beneath each of the main halls. After repeatedly hearing players complain that tejen should have a second entrance to it's bases, I added the other basements. In the process of adding the basements, I heavily refined the rest of the map, including remaking the courtyard several times. I've gone over almost every inch of this map several times, but there are probably still minor flaws.\n\nIt isn't finished, but nothing ever is. Nothing is perfect. You have to release things eventually, and this map has been in development for too long. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nMap file halls.zip (3.51 MB)\nRating\n23\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I love the gameplay and visuals of the original map, and Sauerbraten has surprisingly few duel maps of this type, so I felt this would be a nice foray into mapping. I've started my share of maps before, but usually I get stalled at the texturing and lighting stage. I just don't have a great eye for that kind of thing. I'm happy with how this turned out in certain areas (like the floor around the yellow armour) but if anyone has some good advice I'm happy to take it - hence the open for review status.\n\nThere are some small changes to the layout, scale, and style, but overall it should be quite familiar to players of t7 in QL.\n\nIntended for duels or small FFAs, although a medium-sized map by Sauerbraten conventions.\n\n-Upadate 2011-08-19; fixed some texturing and geometry errors, added SG pickup in health boost room, adjusted some rain particles, clipped floors and sloped ceilings.\n\nMap file t7ish.zip (558.12 KB)\nRating\n49\npoints\n (7 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

With the help of my clanmate |BC|$N!P3R* I was able to buckle down and get to finishing it recently. And turning it into the large ctf/ffa map it is today. Its mostly natural nothing modern in the map, sticking to a more castle style. The pickups are scattered around, but you'll find most of the goodies(eg, health, armor) in the middle of the map.

    "content": "Red Eclipse | Release | Alpha | Content | All Platforms | Creative Commons (BY)\nBlurb a different way to play! Now more balanced, more visually pleasing, and generally improved!\nScreenshot \nGet original file (8KB)\nDetailed description\n\nI've been working on these variables for a while, doing a lot of playtesting and tweaking, and now I've finally optimised them. To try them out, put the file below in your \"data\" folder and bind a key to it (example: /bind n [exec data/gpsettings.cfg]).\n\n(NOTE: These variables work perfeclty for me, so I have no real intention of changing them right now. Feel free to modify these variables to your own tastes, and if you need help consult the \"serverexec.cfg\" file in \"data/extras\".)\n\na brief overview:\n\ngeneral settings: no spawn delay, you can zoom while moving, jumping, etc., double-jump disabled, regeneration time is shorter and now now resembles a wounded soldier's heartbeat (however, you have to wait longer for the process to start), hoverpack can fly as high as you want, hoverpack consumes more energy, sprees are 4 kills instead of 5.\n\nmelee: attack pushes enemies backwards.\n\npistol: more like the Sauerbraten pistol, a dependable automatic weapon that isn't terrible in comparison to the \"real\" weapons. Has a scope, but also bullet drop and a moves reasonably slow.\n\nsword: one-hit-kill. Alt-weapon is a forward \"lunge\" that takes a while to recover from but lets you catch your enemies.\n\nshotgun: reloads one shell at a time, but faster. Less delay between shots. Alt-weap strength and distance much improved.\n\nsmg: slightly more powerful and accurate, with a scope. Critical hits are instant kills.\n\nflamer: flame sticks to walls and lingers. Range is increased by a lot. Best used as a sort of \"tron\" weapon to seal off parts of corridors. Alt-weap has increased range and emits a clous of napalm-like gas, and also takes a bit longer to reload and uses up all the fuel.\n\nplasma: slowed down (easier to dodge), power increased, splash damage also increased. Alt-weap takes a long time to charge, but creates a guided plasma ball.\n\nrifle: modelled after the Sauerbraten rifle: one-hit-kill, one shot per clip, moderate reload time, only a tiny bit of splash damage.\n\ngrenades: explosions look AWESOME with modified variables. Splash damage increased.\n\nrocket: far less deadly, but still a good item. Shoots grenades with minimal splash damage that travel faster and have shorter fuses. Reloads slightly faster. Has multiple shots, but doesn't dominate the battlefield. Again, explosions look totally rad.\n\nI hope you enjoy these variables and are inspired to make your own and share them!\n\nUpdate: made flamer shoot less quickly and be more balanced, stopped plasma from being too big and obscuring people's vision, overall better.\n\nMod file piratevars.cfg (3.99 KB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

(\"/setrow \", where the top row is row #1)\n.-Replaced use of \"universaldelta\" with \"editface\".\n.-Replaced \"arg#\" variable names.\n\nKey features so far:\n-Separate folder for converted image files to avoid confusion with other \".cfg\" files.\n-The alpha channel in the image is made into alpha material in-game.\n-Images can be added on-the-fly; no need to restart Sauer.\n-Image files are really just \".cfg\" files, so they are open to many possibilities.\n-A single \"cube_art\" function for easy keybinding; (Just put the line \"editbind N cube_art\" in \"autoexec.cfg\")\n-A lovely little GUI menu for loading Cube-Art images.\n-\"prevrow\" function for redrawing rows. (\"/prevrow \")\n-\"clearimg\" function to reset the script.\n-New \"setrow\" function to go directly to the row specified. (\"/setrow \", where the top row is row #1)\n\nHow to use:\n1. Follow the included \"README--INSTRICTIONS.txt\" to install.\n2. (Windows Users)Use the \"SauerImageConverter.exe\" included in the package to convert the image you wish to draw in-game.\n2. (Non-Windows Users)Download Unixfreak's \"Cube-Art Image Converter\" and convert the image you wish to draw in-game. (http://www.quadropolis.us/node/3139)\n3. Place the converted file(\".cfg\") into the \"cube-art\" folder.\n4. In-game, use the \"cube_art\" keybind to open the menu, and select the Cube-Art image you wish to draw.\n5. Select a cube to draw from, stand back, and use the \"cube_art\" keybind again to draw a row of pixels from the image.\n6. Repeat step 5 until the image is complete. Use \"/prevrow\" to redo a row if you mess up.\n\nSpecial Notes:\n-A good \"rule of thumb\" is to crop your image's height to no more than around 60 pixels. Anything larger becomes tedious to draw.\n-This script DOES work in coopedit mode, but it WILL cause brief bursts of lag as each row is drawn.\n-\"nompedit\" does not need to be turned on manually for this script to work online, however you will still need to \"/sendmap\" for others to see your art.\n\nSpecial Thanks:\n--To UnixFreak for making a better image converter; graphics-related programming isn't exactly my cup of tea.\n--To the, now dead, MMC clan and it's forum for support and hosting earlier versions.\n\nConfig file Cube-Art Version 1.1.zip (358.37 KB)\nRating\n87\npoints\n (9 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Various Licenses\n*\n*\nStarred Content\nBlurb A huge modelpack\nScreenshot \nGet original file (611KB)\nDetailed description\n\nInformation\nHere it is, the (probably) biggest modelpack ever posted on quadropolis.\nIt contains 184 models which are all have separate themes, like urbanic, medieval/gothic, tropical, industrial, egyptic, etc.\nAlmost all (like 90%) of the models have included bumpmap and masks, for even better quality (except models like plants or trees, because they don't need reflectivity) and have a separate configuration-file.\n\nA screenshot with a way higher resolution is accessible over here.\nBecause the file-size is 210Mb I couldn't post it in just 1 part and that's why it's been split into several parts (it currently is 116,5Mb).\n- The egyptic and furniture models are downloadable here.\n- The gothic and humanic models over here.\n- The industrial and light models can be obtained here.\n- The miscellaneous, urbanic, vegetation and vehicle models can be downloaded here\n\nLicensing\nThe license is GNU-GPL 2.0 and CC-atribution, which let me understand that it should be okay to post (but rename and modify as well!) those models, as long as I refer the author's name which I'll do just now:\nThanks to sitters-electronics for creating all of the models.\n\nWhen using those models, be sure to give sitters-electronics credit for creating the models and (if there is still space left) some credit to me for distributing and making them compatible with cube engine 2.\n\nThe reason of posting this is to give such beautiful models another chance, to make mapping even easier as it is now and for me to learn how to set up a proper model-configuration, while also learning about modeling.\nAll models should not be distributed within this community yet again (the Cube Engine community in overall). Link to this content instead.\n\nSidenotes\nEven it's noted for \"Sauerbraten\", it's actually designed for Cube Engine 2 and is fully compatible with Red Eclipse v1.10 (because there aren't any playermodels involved in the modelpack which have animations).\nI won't make the models compatible with AssaultCube, because if so then I can start all over again with setting up configuration-files for the models and I assumed using .md2 is more common in that game than .md3-files. AssaultCube doesn't seems to have a good documentary about importing models anyways (not even the required commands). Since Assaultcube can't handle bumpmapped-skins or masks and uses way different commands in their configuration-files, that would lack some detail either.\n\nI hope you also are just as font of (some) of the models as I am and maybe even use them in a map or mod.\n\nTo Do\n- Improving the masks and bump-maps of some models, because some could be made better.\n- Improving the animations of models like switches, torture devices and maybe I'll even add animations to the vehicles and playermodels.\n- Linking several models together, like the \"faraothrone\" model which exist out of 3 different parts.\n- Adding a better screenshot, since there are a lot models which are also very nice and deserve to be on the screenshot.\n\nImprovements\n7th of September 2011\n- Found out MisfitModels3D is a great program when converting .obj or .md2-files to .md3, because it sometimes even decreases the file-size 5 times. But when doing so the only problem is that it doesn't seems to convert curved shapes perfect every time (it sometimes drops or moves vertexes). But for flat and/or easy shapes, it's really nice!\n- Repackaged the whole modelpack and also made it fully compatible with Red Eclipse. If you want to use it for Red Eclipse, just be sure you renamed the \"packages\" folder into \"data\".\n- Added some more mapmodels like a crane and human characters (too bad no animations or linking yet).\n\n27th of May 2012\n- Deleted several masks from the egypticfurniture pack, to save up file-size. They now use the diffuse texture as masks, but configured so the mask is red.\nI'll make sure the rest can be downloaded soon.\n\n28th of May 2012\n- Did the exact same process as on 27th of May with the gothichuman pack. It has saved more as 23Mb on file-size because of that!\n- Resized all skins (also the bump-mapped) which were bigger as 512p by 50%. Saved up almost 35Mb by doing so, lost a little bit quality though.\n- Also resized the skins in the furniture pack. Saved about 6,7Mb on file-size compared to it's previous version.\n\n30th of May 2012\n- Redid the same process on the industriallights pack. It saved up more than 22,5Mb.\n- Exported the crane model to .md3-format (pretty painful when receiving error messages all the time and having more as 120 groups at 1 mesh). Still need to add tags though.\n\n22th of October 2012\n- Finally finished what I've started (as far as you can call it finished). Redid the last part of the modelpack (urbanicvegetatevehicles).\n\nRating\n170\npoints\n (17 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Two options are offered; auto-select in which the largest teams are deployed such that the game will remain balanced, and manual-select in which the user can select who exactly will play from either clan via the included GUI menu - absolutely no unspectating and team switching needed (not even for yourself). If you have any suggestion as to how this script can be improved, or any comments in general, please don't hesitate to make a post.\n\nThe GUI is bound to key \"M\" by default, this can easily be changed to the user's liking.\n\nSpecial Thanks: RaZgRiZ for his support in the construction and optimization of many of the 'Miscellaneous Functions\".\n\nNote: Some server mods require team persisting (HopMod - #persist 1, XSBS - #persistteam on) to avoid shuffling of teams after each map change; make sure that persistent teams are enabled before starting a clanwar (with or without this script).\n\nChanges/Updates:\n(9/14/2011) v1.0 - Initial release.\n(9/16/2011) v1.1 - Minor bug fixes, eliminated the risk of a player connecting in the middle of clanwar setup and causing problems.\n(9/21/2011) v1.2 - Fixed the inputted mode checker (cw_ismodevalid) and made some other small improvements.\n(9/28/2011) v1.3 - Dramatically improved the mode checker (cw_ismodevalid).\n(10/2/2011) v1.4 - Now you are able to start a clanwar using the manual option even if there is a client that is a member of both clans. Other small fixes.\n(10/2/2011) v1.5 - Changes to the GUI, overall layout is still the same, however.\n(10/3/2011) v1.6 - In manual mode, you can no longer select the same client in both clan lists (eliminating the chance of doing so accidentally).\n(10/11/2011) v1.7 - Typo fixes and other small improvements.\n(10/15/2011) v1.8 - Improvements to the clan lists; now if there are two people with the same name, their client numbers will appear in purple exactly like what can be seen in the normal scoreboard.

Because Cube Engine (2) isn't great for creating curves anyways (duh, look at the name?).\nWhy only cubes? Because if you could use the disadvantage of the engine, as advantage, by not trying to create expensive curve-like geometry.\n\nThe rules of event:\nCreate 1 map especially for capture the flag. Adding any other mode to it is at your own risk but can have consequences when people vote.\nSize doesn't matter, but there's a maximum of 24 players wandering around on the map and a minimum of 6 (like for clanwars).\nYou have 60 days to create the entire map from scratch. This should be enough for a ctf map. Why not just 30 days again? Because as you've maybe noticed on the 30-day mapping challenge, the ctf-maps were failing in such short time.\nThe actual date of starting this challenge:\n- Saturday the 22th of October 2011 at 0:00 (GMT+1, timezones will be checked)\nThe actual date of ending this challenge:\n- Tuesday the 20th of December 2011 (and so do you start on that date and end on that date!).\nWhy this decision? Because that make the contest end up close before Christmas, Where it seems like most people have time for gaming (so for voting maps also).\nYou need to post on at least once a week (at last every saturday) a screenshot or the upload the .ogz-file itself of your map.\n\nAllowings and disallowings and how to apply can be read on the website itself, just click on the URL below.\n\nURL http://quadmapcontest.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=userevent&action=display&thread=130\nRating\n30\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

But as some comments have given me some suggestions (which are quite logical), I deleted the \"odd\" looking town (sometimes a design can be improved by going back to one of it's earlier stages and build up from that position again).\n\nThe map has pretty much features which any (un)official maps don't have (from the custom shader on the teleports, till even the so called \"jumpcurve\").\nWhen I started creating this map, I was convinced the flow and gameplay should stand above any other point, that's why I've spend most of the time on that.\nIt has several original parts in it, like the jumppad-curves to reach the flag, but also the teleport system from base to base and the geometry of the map.\nIt's designed to be played on any capture the flag mode, doesn't matter which. Every path from flag to flag takes between 10 and 15 seconds, if you wouldn't meet any opponent. After some previous updates, modes like deathmatch (not recommended though), capture or hold can be played as well. I would recommend the amount of players from 10 up to 18, since there are a lot of pickups spawning on the map, but getting camped on a playerstart isn't much to worry about either (since there are fairly enough of them, spread out in each base).\nThe gameplay is designed on such way that if you just have a bad aiming but like to sneak up opponents from behind or you're the type of player which has a clear mind and great aiming, there's fun for everyone.\n\nJust travel trough the map a while and you'll definitely feel how much time and care has been spend in it. Feel free to leave a comment!\n\nSidenotes\nSince the screenshot isn't very clear to me (because of the low resolution allowed on quadropolis), here's a better view of the map.\n\nBecause the map contains a lot of custom textures and models, please notify me (like posting a comment on this content) which textures or model isn't getting loaded/looking odd.\n\nLicense notifications\nI would like to thank Yves Allaire for the great textures, Barry Collins for the Dissonance models and all people who commented about the map and/or gave me advices which leaded to this result.\n\nLeft to do\n- Nothing else where I'm aware of, be sure to comment if you still think something should be improved!\n\nImprovements\n12th of December 2012\n- Replaced to teleports of each base for a cave, the quad-room has now 4 ways in and out.\n- Tweaked the lighting on several places.\n- Added more details like light-sources and such.\n\nFor other improvements in the past, see the change-log at attachments.\n\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?pz13dbwzwf4gzwi\nRating\n109\npoints\n (14 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nchangelog.txt\t9.51 KB\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\nBitwise Operators\n\nIntroduction\nUnfortunately, bitwise operators are rarely utilized in the scripts that I’ve been seeing on Quadropolis. Whether this is because their use is scarcely needed or because people just don’t know how to use them, I don’t know. However, I’d like to take this opportunity to inform you on the magic of bitwise operators. I’ll focus on cubescript, but this can sort of be expanded to many other computer languages; bitwise operators are fairly universal.\n\nBinary System\nTo understand how bitwise operators work, you’ll first need to understand how a computer interprets numbers – in base-2. If you input a number in our normal base-10 system, the computer will translate it into base-2 and work with it that way. Converting numbers to and from binary (i.e. base-2) is easy, but here are the first few to give you a feel of how the system works,\n\n0 0000\n1 0001\n2 0010\n3 0011\n4 0100\n5 0101\n6 0110\n7 0111\n8 1000\n\nNote that if you have a zero at the start of the number, it can be omitted - I just included it to have everything line up. So, let’s say we wanted to convert 13 to a binary number, there are many algorithms to do this but essentially what we must do is write 13 as a sum of powers of 2, and then ‘concatenate’ the coefficients to obtain a base-2 number. This is what I mean,\n\n13 = 1*(8) + 1*(4) + 0*(2) + 1*(1) = 1*(2^3) + 1*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) + 1*(2^0)\n\nWe can better visualize this by writing the right-hand side of the equality above vertically,\n\n1*(2^3)\n1*(2^2)\n0*(2^1)\n1*(2^0)\n\nThe vertical column of 0s and 1s tells us the value of each bits (a bit is either a 0 or a 1; binary numbers are composed of these) in the base-2 number,\n\n13 in binary = 1101\n\nEssentially, we are determining which powers of two are ‘turned on or off’ and expressing that by writing out a string of 1s and 0s. Now that we have that sorted, we can move on to actual bitwise operators.\n\n‘And’ Operator: &\nNot to be confused with ‘&&’, the ‘and’ bitwise operator, denoted by the single ampersand ‘&’, is the first bitwise operator that we will consider. This operator essentially determines whether both bits are 1. For example, if we wanted to use this operator on the numbers 3 and 5, we would determine the result by converting both 3 and 5 to binary and determining each bit of the result.\n\n3 = 011\n5 = 101\n\nWorking bit by bit,\n\n0 and 1 are not both 1, so the first bit is 0,\n1 and 0 are not both 1, so the second bit is 0,\n1 and 1 are both 1, so the third bit is 1.\n\nSo the result is 001, which is 1 in base-10. You can try it out in cubescript, just type /echo (& 3 5), in the cubescript language the bitwise operator comes first and is followed by the two numbers, much like the ways in which addition and subtraction are done. We will return to this operator later to show how it can be used to perform some nifty tricks.\n\n‘Or’ Operator: |\nAgain, not to be confused with ‘||’, the single vertical line ‘|’ is used to signify the ‘or’ operator. Unlike the ‘and’ operator, this operator will determine whether either of the bits are 1. For example, again using 3 and 5:\n\n3 = 011\n5 = 101\n\nWorking bit by bit,\n\nEither 0 and 1 are 1, so the first bit is 1,\nEither 1 and 0 are 1, so the second bit is 1,\nEither 1 and 1 are 1, so the third bit is also 1.\n\nSo the result is 111, which is 7 in base-10. Again, you can try it in cubescript by issuing the command /echo (| 3 5).\n\n'Xor' Operator: ^\nHere’s yet another one. This will determine whether both bits are different. Lets try it with 3 and 5:\n\n3 = 011\n5 = 101\n\nWorking bit by bit,\n\n0 and 1 are different, so the first bit is 1,\n1 and 0 are different, so the second bit is 1,\n1 and 1 are not different, so the third bit is 0.\n\nAnd so we have 110, or 6 in base-10. You can verify this with /echo (^ 3 5).\n\n'Not' Operator: ~\n\nDon’t confuse this with ‘!’. This operator simply switches the value of each bit; it’s only used on one number as opposed to the other bitwise operators we’ve looked at which involve two numbers. Lets try it with the 3:\n\n3 = 011\n\nBit by bit,\n\nNot 0 is 1, so the first bit is 1,\nNot 1 is 0, so the second bit is 0,\nNot 1 is 0, so the third bit is 0.\n\nSo we would expect to get 100 or 4 in base-10. BUT, this is clearly not what we receive if you try /echo (~ 3), in fact, we actually get -4! Why? Because one bit is allocated to a +/- sign before the number, and this operator switches ALL of the bits, therefore the number changes sign as well. Here’s a fancy trick for adding 1 to the value of a variable (I used x in this case):\n\n\nx = (* -1 (~ $x))\n\n\nThis can always be replaced with the simpler x = (+ 1 $x), but the above example is included to illustrate that these operators are far from useless, as can be seen below.\n\nGUI Bit Fields\nArguably one of the most eloquent uses of bitwise operators in cubescript, the GUI bit field allows us to create complex scripts in which very few variables are used. These GUI elements have the following format:\n\nguibitfield [name of bitfield] [v - variable to effect] [power of 2]\n\nSo how does it work? Well, when the bit field is turned on, the bit it corresponds to is also turned on in the variable v (above). Here’s an example:\n\n\nvar1 = 0;\nnewgui gbf [\nguibitfield “GBF1” var1 1\nguibitfield “GBF2” var1 2\nguibitfield “GBF3” var1 4\nguibitfield “GBF4” var1 8\n]\n\n\nWe initially set var1 to 0, as you can see from above. Lets say we activate GBF2, this would in turn activate the ‘2’ bit on in var1 and so var1 would equal 2. Now, if we have GBF2 and GBF3 on, we would have turned on the ‘2’ bit and the ‘4’ bit, so var1 would equal 6. Simple enough, right? Now how can we extract this information from the value of var1? We use the ‘and’ operator. If we have GBF2 and GBF3 activated, then var1 in binary would be 110 (6 in base-10). What we really care about is finding a way to determine whether various bit fields are indeed turned on, and we can do this in the following manner:\n\n\nif (& $var1 2) [echo “GBF2 is on!”]\nif (& $var1 4) [echo “GBF3 is on!”]\n\n\nPretty cool, huh? Take a look at what we’re really doing (consider the first ‘if’ statement), we’re using the ‘and’ operator on var1 and 2 (number 2, not var2):\n\n$var1 = 110\n2 = 010\n\nNotice that the '2' bit is on in both of the binary numbers above.\n\nThe only way for GBF2 to be on is if the ‘2’ bit is on in var1, and therefore (& $var1 2) is non-zero! A similar argument goes for GBF1, 3 and 4. With this, you can ‘squeeze’ many variables into one all-inclusive variable.\n\nWell that’s my little tutorial, hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I did writing it. Please let me know if there’s anything that you want me to make more clear or elaborate on.\n\n‹ Eihrul - Respect Quick cubescript support ›\n\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "Chaos | 2011-10-05 19:38",
    "image": null,
    "content": "General Discussion\nAll About Loops\n\nIntroduction\nI know a few people who are trying to learn the basics of cubescript (and I'm sure there are many more out there), and so I thought I'd write a tutorial on loops - a fundamental part of any computer language. In essence, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until or while a particular condition is satisfied. I'll be discussing a few ways that loops can be utilized in cubescript.\n\nThe Basic Loop\nThe basic 'loop' command is quite easy to understand at its fundamental level. It goes like this,\n\nloop i N [ body ]\n\nThis will exec body N times (i always starts at 0) increasing the value of i by 1 for each iteration. So if you wanted to quickly say the numbers 0, 1, 2… 9, you could use:\n\nloop i 10 [ say $i ]\n\nAlso worth noting is that there is nothing special about 'i', you can just as easily use any other letter (or even strings of letters). Here's a quick exercise; see if you can find a way to quickly say all of the odd numbers from 0 to 10. Once you've had a minute to think about it, compare your answer with this,\n\nloop i 6 [ say (* 2 $i) ]\n\nWhat we're doing here is multiplying 'i' by 2 before we say it, resulting in an even number.\n\nIf you haven't played around with them to already know, sleeps in loops just don't work the way you want them to. For example, if you tried,\n\nloop i 5 [ sleep 1000 [ echo $i ] ]\n\nyou'll notice that there is a one second pause after which the whole loop is carried out as if there was no sleep involved. And not only that, the value of 'i' seems to be off. This happens because the loop continues on while the sleeps are in progress (this might be hard to understand at first) and so, in the end, all the iterations seem to be executed as if there was one sleep in front of the entire loop. This can be fixed by increasing the sleep time for every iteration. As for the 'i', we need to refer to its value outside of the sleep, therefore we should use '@i' instead of '$i'. Putting it all together, we have:\n\nloop i 5 [ sleep (* $i 1000) [ echo @i ] ]\n\nThis is does what we wanted the previous line of code to do; echo the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 with a 1 second sleep between consecutive echoes.\n\nHere's an interesting challenge: try to find a way to quickly echo the following; \"0 0\", \"0 1\", \"0 2\" … \"0 4\", \"1 0\", \"1 1\" … \"1 4\" … … \"4 4\", in other terms, a way to echo every possible way in which 2 not necessarily distinct numbers can be selected from the set {0 1 2 3 4}. After some thought, it becomes evident that we'll need to embed one loop inside of another as such,\n\nloop i 5 [ loop k 5 [ echo (concat @i $k) ] ]\n\nAgain, we use the '@' because we are referring to the value of 'i' at a different level in the code.\n\nLooping Through Lists\nLets say we had the list \"2 3 5 7 11\" and we wanted to quickly echo each element of that list in order, we could either use the normal 'loop' command and include (at \"2 3 4 7 11\" $i), or we could use 'looplist'. This command works as such,\n\nlooplist i L [ body ]\n\nThis is similar to loop, except now 'i' takes on each element of the list L. So, returning to the previous example, we can echo each element like this,\n\nlooplist i \"2 3 5 7 11\" [ echo $i ]\n\nPretty simple. Another exercise: find a way to quickly echo all of the names of the clients connected to a particular server. Here's how I would do it,\n\nlooplist i (listclients 1) [ echo (getclientname $i) ]\n\nIt's not hard to see that this would loop through the list of client numbers and echo the name that corresponds to each number.\n\nLooping Through Files\nWhether you knew it or not, it is in fact possible to loop through files in the sauerbraten folder using a command called 'loopfiles'. The format is like this,\n\nloopfiles f dir ext [ body ]\n\nThis loops through the files in directory 'dir' with extension 'ext', executing 'body' for each iteration. As expected, 'f' gets assigned to the file name each iteration as well. So if we wanted to echo the names of all the screenshots in the 'screenshots' folder we could use,\n\nloopfiles f screenshots png [ echo $f ]\n\nAgain, nothing too complicated. If we ever wanted to loop through all of the files in a certain directory with their extensions, we would simply leave 'ext' blank. So if you happen to have images that are not png files in the screenshots folder, you could use,\n\nloopfiles f screenshots \"\" [ echo $f ]\n\nYou can see 'loopfiles' used in this Screenshot Script.\n\nLooping Under a Given Condition\nTo loop under a certain condition we use 'while'. This command checks a condition, if it's true it executes the body of the loop, it it's false it terminates the loop. It's formatted like this,\n\nwhile [ cond ] [ body ]\n\nSo if we wanted a different way to echo the numbers 0, 1, 2… 9 we could use,\n\nvar1 = 0\nwhile [ (< $var1 10) ] [ echo $var1; var1 = (+ $var1 1) ]\n\nThe condition does indeed need to be placed into square brackets or you may encounter problems. This really isn't used that much because often times a simple 'loop' will do the job; it's still a useful tool, however.\n\nInfinite Loops\nThere isn't a specific command for infinite loops, but rather a method that can be used to create them. Lets say we wanted to continuously echo \"Hello World\" every 3 seconds, we could do the following:\n\nhwecho = [ echo \"Hello World\"; sleep 3000 [ hwecho ] ]\n\nWe are assigning a function that calls itself, and will therefore do so continuously. Issuing the command /hwecho will result in this continuous echoing. This is yet another tool that quite often comes in handy.\n\nLoops within GUI Menus\nLoops can also be used within GUI menus. For example, if we wanted 10 GUI buttons that would echo 0, 2, 3… 9 if pressed, we could create the GUI as follows,\n\n\nnewgui looptest [\nloop i 10 [ guibutton $i [ echo @i ] ]\n]\n\n\nWe simply have a loop within the definition of the GUI. Here you would have 10 buttons labeled 0 - 9 that would echo the number they are labeled with. This is a very basic example, you can see more sophisticated uses of loops within GUIs if you look at the ClanWar Script.\n\nWell there you have it, loops in a nutshell.

    "image": null,
    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Guide\n*\n*\nStarred Content\n\nI found this most helpful, and haven't seen him explain it this well before and didn't want it to get lost in the comments of node/3184 'Why's there fewer starred submissions these days?', so I politely quote it here.\n\n---\n\neihrul | 2011-10-15 01:40\nThe problem is that the mapping community is shooting itself in the foot. Quadropolis built mappers from the ground up, but now tries to operate at a level of sophistication that does not allow mappers to get feedback and grow. As has been said, new mappers are shoved away when they want community and feedback. Its standards are too high and simultaneously the wrong standards. I have a rough set of standards which I apply to maps for inclusion, which are really a balance of many aspects. If you only focus on one of the aspects, to the neglect of another one, the map is unlikely to get included. If you do a passable attempt at all of them, the map is likely to get included, even if it is not amazing. The bar is not amazing, the bar is balance. They are:\n\n1) Performance. If the map is 400K verts because you spammed lots of little details everywhere, it is probably not getting included. 200K is more or less a sane top-end for big Hallo-sized maps. Spamming lots of water planes is almost always a no-no, especially in combination with spamming lots of geometry, since they multipled eachother. Try to stick to at most 1 water-plane in view at any one time.\n\n2) Texturing. Texturing matters not just for appearance, but so the player can actually see where the hell they are going. I'm not trying to single anyone out, but if I am handed a map with very complex flow, and all hallways look the same because it's one solid gray mass or a such a noisy mass of random textures that I can't remember a pattern to them as I am running by, then the flow of the map has become more theoretical than actual. And, well, neither looks nice either. I may as well be running through a dark and twisty maze only to be eaten by a grue. :)\n\n3) Lighting. The comments for texturing above apply to lighting, though with some slight difference. Too much noisy lighting with lots of different technicolor lights or almost-moire-pattern shadows from competing lights can make it hard to see and it just looks ugly. Even a simple sunlight with some skylight with some occasional accent lighting can be good enough for a lot of maps. Most people just try too hard here.\n\n3) Geometry. I am actually rather forgiving of blocky detail, and people tend to overfocus on geometric detail to a fault. Spamming lots of noisy detail really tends to make maps look worse in general, and actually detracts from nice texturing and lighting, especially the texturing. You need to work with the cubes, not against them. Large details tend to work better than small ones, especially because at the pace people run around in Sauer your small detailing will mostly be ignored as people run by like cheetahs. Let the textures do the small detail.\n\n4) Particles. Don't spam them. Sometimes particle spam can work in the right context, but usually it just looks a bit lame. It's not a deal breaker, but never the less, lame.\n\n5) Mapmodels. Same caveats as spamming lots of small geometry detail.\n\n6) Flow. Cramped tunnel systems or cramped hallways are bad. Too much verticality is bad. Too many teleports is bad. Too many jumppads are bad. Too open is bad (especially in CTF and capture), less so for FFA. Too many twists and turns is bad. The most popular FFA layout in Sauer seems to remain a hole with a ledge around it (complex). I think people overthink this one a lot as well.\n\n7) Items. I think common sense mostly reins here, and that it is rare for people to really screw this up badly. Make sure items are available at appropriate frequencies according to their benefits. It is perfectly okay to omit the quad and health boosts and yellow armour in a map if you don't like their effect on gameplay for your map too, but generally all other items should be present. Quads/health boost/yellow armour very rare. Green armour kinda rare. Rockets/chaingun should be used judiciously. Shotgun/rifle/grenades a bit more available than rockets/chaingun. Health to taste. Pistol cartridges should only be placed only to insult/spite the player, but are not terribly useful.\n\n8) Clipping. Usually I end up going in and fixing this myself on almost all included maps, but people never clip their maps adequately, so that the poor baby kittens escape and fall off the map and die. Save the kittens.\n\n9) File size. The Sauerbraten download size is already big. Many people still have shit connections, and even if they don't, a huge download makes it less likely for impulse downloaders to try out the game because it will still take a long time to download. I don't care if you think otherwise. The download is not increasing 20MB for an FFA map, and even 5MB will make me skeptical. For 5MB, your map must be pure unadulterated awesome-sauce, like, better than almost every other map in the game. Smaller file size maps that are less a hindrance on the total package size are more likely to be included.\n\n---",

I started this about 2-3 weeks ago, and is the only map i have been editing on for this time.\n\nHere is a larger screenshot showing more of the map. And also an aerial view of the map:\n\nIts themed around a dying star, in which the planet was become scorched, things are melting, almost volcano like, however i'm not too keen on the colour orange, so tried to avoid using the lava material, and tried to create a glowing effect in the rooms with red lighting. There's also a few roofs ripped open with claw marks trailing from them, i tried to give the appearance of a monster on the lose.\n\nI'm still considering changing a few parts of the layout and possibly moving a few of the regen bases.\n\nThings which are missing/not finished:\n- Waypoints are temporary (not optimal, a few bots will get stuck every now and then)\n- A few more details in the emtpier looking sections\n- Move some of the regen bases if the layout changes\n- Change the brick texture on the staircases\n\nAlso, the culling (filling in un-used space) was done because i didn't intend to make an outside section of the map, and felt that no detail was needed outside of the map, in my opinion it helps avoid the use of clip material and becomes easier to work with.\n\nI don't think there are any geometry errors, although if you find any please tell me about them. Can't wait for any feedback, as i honestly haven't really shown anyone this map since i started it.\n\nMap file scorch.zip (1.5 MB)\nRating\n41\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

If your sure it's still missing some, please comment right on this node or contact me via \"supersauer@live.nl\".\nAll \"odd\" rendered textures are intended to be rendered on such way, to show the possibilities of Cube Engine 2 (Sauerbraten).\n\nThis prefabricated configuration file is meant to show which shaders are possible to use.\nIt has been tested on an official non-modified version of the Justice-edition of Sauerbraten and the SVN after Justice-Edition, so don't fully expect it will still be up to date if using any of the specified shaders on any other release of Sauerbraten.\n\nCredits\nI would like to thank the person(s) who made the \"docs\" on \"sauerbraten.org\" and the person(s) who create the \"wiki\", as both contain some information about all settings, but not everything. I also would like to thank the development-team for their great work of Cube Engine (2).\n\nThere is no credit needed to use this, but when distributing so, please give me a credit as it contains pretty much information which I've putted several hours of research in it.\n\nTo-do List\nAdd explanation about commands like \"texrotate\", \"texscale\", \"texcolor\" and \"texscroll\", with all of their ingame variants (as the \"vscale\" command).\nAdd some more explanation of textureblending.\nContinue creating a map which shows an example of several features (like for showing textureblending, envmap-rendering, etc).\n\nImprovements\n9th of November 2011\nPutted more detailed information about how bump-mapped texture get used in Cube Engine 2.\nExplained the some more about the \"setvertexparam\" command.\nPutted a screenshot which shows of the shader-settings into the zip-file.\n\n11th of November 2011\n- Removed the screenshot in the zip-file and posted it in the content itself.\n\n12th of November 2011\n- Replaced the screenshot for a better one.\n- Fixed some small typos in the prefab itself.\n- Replaced the \"harmony skybox\" specified line for the \"forge skybox\".\n- Added explanation about commands which have support for rotating, offsetting and colouring any other textures than the diffuse texture (like the offsetting bump-mapped texture or colouring the diffuse texture only so the glow-mapped texture won't be affected, for example).\n- Added the custom shader of the hudguns which has been used in the \"assassin edition\" and the \"ctf edition\".\n\n16th of Novermber 2011\n- Reviewed and changed the explanation of how bump-, specular- and height-mapped textures get rendered (it should be correct now).\n- Changed the default settings which were notified to the correct values which are stated into \"stdshader.cfg\".\n- Looked for some more shaders but failed. These are probably are all currently available shaders which are usefull for rendering textures (as shaders like \"fogworld\" exists too, but won't have any use for rendering a texture).\n\n27th of November 2011\n- It's been a while again and I managed to create a small map which is intended as example of how certain shaders could appear. It's not done yet and is SVN only (noticed I was creating it on the SVN version after I already made 3 rooms so I wasn't willing to start all over again).\n- Added some more shader-settings (like \"bumpenvspecparallaxworld\", which only needs 2 other textures next to it's diffuse texture).\n- Added another interpreted way of the custom shader, so it is easier to configure (thanks to Dekrow). It isn't configurable ingame though.\n\n3rd of December 2011\n- Made more process in finishing the sample-map. I'll probably make a map-prefab of this content, as It's pretty illogical to create contents for a material-prefab and a skybox-prefab also.\n- I hope that would make this content very useful to any mapper, no matter how much experience he has (as everyone will forget something from time to time).\nDamn, wondering when this would be a starred content with all that useful information :P.\n\n7th of March 2012\n- Nearly finished the map itself. I probably will separate it from this content and start a new, more related content.\n\n10th of March 2012\n- Moved the map to another node so this content stays preserved as a prefabrication of textures only.\n\nConfig file texture_prefab.zip (6.78 KB)\nRating\n50\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

It is a TDM/CTF map in which each team has a large bunker facing the other (with numerous points of cover littered between). The idea is that you need to run the length of the bridge directly in front of the enemies bunker to get their flag, and run back through again to score. There are plenty of places in which cover can be sought during this process. I think that the map plays best with 4 to 6 players, as it is quite small, but provides very fast paced gameplay. Please feel free to comment or add suggestions, as this is my first map and I understand that I have a lot of learning to do.

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nStatus : Need help from good scripters (and from others after)\n\nOk guys, as you know, I'm pretty painful/distressing in my kind ! But I really need some help !\n\nSo, to stop polluting everything with my Quadro too many questions I am going to centralize everything on that node. It will be easier for everyone. I would try to maintain it by deleting it regularly (it would be a shame to block the server again ;-)\n\nI therefore call all Sauer's experts such as Chaos, SRBS, Razgriz, Suicizer and all the others to help me in my project.\n\nAs you may have noticed, I'm not very good at English, so forgive me if I use the wrong vocabulary of GoogleTrad ;-)\n\n\n\n* THE PROJECT :\n\n- The origins :\nThis is an old project I had stopped and I took recently. At the time, I downloaded all the contents of Quadropolis (several gigabytes) and all other projects based on CubeEngine2...\nI recently set out to create a gutter, then, of course, as there was not proper texture for the roof, I've created some, and then I found a free pack of textures that I have undertaken to integrate, then I have creating other textures which missed... I temporarily stop the developement of this package because it quickly became clear to me that he had to implement new features to the Sauer's GUI for integrate all these new content.\n\n- The definition :\nThis project has several stages :\nA) The first goal is to improve CubeEngine without changing a single line of code so as not to create yet another fork.\nThe first step must take the form of a non-invasive package for Sauer and consists of two things :\n\n1) Gather all the additional contents (of quality) already created (except maps !) and create or adapt some others (as long as they are free to use !). This is to definitely get out of the 20th century ;-)\n2) Create new structures to make the setup more modular and therefore, to fill any gaps of the GUI. This begins first by the establishment of new structures, internationalization (of all that can be translated without modifying the source code), the management of new and special contents, the profiles management (as in all modern games), and going to create a better documentation !\n\nB) In a second step, the goal might be to create an ultimate fork by modifying the source code but in the context of a real engine simple and versatile, and not simply just as a game. (but we are not there yet !!!)\n\nThe project is placed in the Public Domain (or lisense CC0).\n\nSo a lot of work to do to refresh our favorite game ;-)\n\n\n\n* LINKS :\n\n- The old textures package : http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JMKOGXBZ ; http://dl.free.fr/tZw1aU1dI/FBP_ultimate_texture_package_preview.zip\n\n\n\nSEE ALSO MY KNOWLEDGE \"DATABASE\" ATTACHED FILE (just below) !!!\nUPDATES : Knowledge database, actual unfinished UCElib, and bonus \"colored_speech.cfg\"\n\n‹ IQM exporters and Blender 2.60 30 Day Mapping Challenge- Ended ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nAttachment\tSize\nucelib.cfg_.txt\t13.98 KB\ncolored_speech.cfg_.txt\t10.39 KB\ngetpaths_lib.cfg_.txt\t10.37 KB\ndblists_lib.cfg_.txt\t12.89 KB\nstrings_lib.cfg_.txt\t12.49 KB\nuninstall_lib.cfg_.txt\t1.33 KB\nknowledge base.txt\t17.78 KB\nlogin to post comments",

Or when someone is truly horrible at doing things right. Apart from that however..\n\nHe may not be the first, or the second, or the third, what does it matter. For cubescript, it's practically the first command-line quick-connect script, with mine coming second but being SVN only. I do wonder however how you're doing to implement such a thing into the framework, is it based on cubescript at all? Or are you hoping to convert it to another language?\n\nAnd i'm confident he will add the comments necessary. Would would go past thing chance for fame? ^_^\nreply to 3starRaZgRiZ\n\nmapc | 2011-12-12 17:46\n\n\n(I switched from the gandalf acc to this one, sorry for the confusion).\n\nYes, apply 1 and 2 for me :D (but it is not that bad).\nSadly cbs is a very bad designed language: There is for instance only a global namespace and there is only strings. Even the lists are space separated, not escaped strings. (I'd like to give you a complete lists, but this would be one or two paragraphs of text, so not in this comment ;) ).\n\nYes, thats why I am thinking about integrating it :). However, command line again means a problem with the global namespace :(\nThe framework is entierely cubescript and aims at resolving some of the issues, nicer installation, plugin-based (no more hazzle with adding stuff to autoexec.cfg) and a little bit of namespacing:\n\n(concatword $namespace $varname) = $value\n\nYup, hope so :)\n\nCheers,\nmapc\n\nsrbs | 2011-12-14 04:46\n\n\n@mapc\n\"I'd like to give you a complete lists, but this would be one or two paragraphs of text, so not in this comment ;)\"\nI'd love to see this list.\n\n\"Sadly cbs is a very bad designed language:\"\nNot every language NEEDS every feature known to the programming world. It is perfectly adequate for what it is designed for.\n\nWhat isn't designed very well is, in fact, your \"framework.\" For large projects like that, one should (as with all languages) first learn the features, quirks, and idioms of said language and design accordingly. And if my config.cfg file is some 500KB after using 0.9.4, I won't ever use it again, especially since every function of every script has variable names relating to the current plug-in\n\n@Razgriz\n\"Would would go past thing chance for fame?\"\nwut?\n\nsrbs\n\nmapc | 2011-12-15 12:48\n\n\n@srbs\n\nI do not criticize the lack of features in the language, but the way the language is designed (in other words: how you do, what you do with cbs).\n\nYour last argument was an ad hominem argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) and therefore a rhetorical trick without being constructive at all. Please stop this, I am annoyed by this.\nYour config file is that big, because the way configuration works (described below) and because of the lack of memory management (described also below). Big codebase => Big conf. This issue can not be resolved without having control of the configuration process. Sorry.\nThe framework is btw written with some of the issues below in mind. The usage of vars for every plugin for instance makes the whole framework much more secure.\nThe Points of criticism:\n\nEverything is a string (partially lack of types)\nLists are space-seperated not-escaped lists\nThere are too many ways to generate and modify function-strings (e.g. macros, the three braces)\nThere are too many ways to call function-strings (macros, as closures...)\nMetaprogramming is just string-modification and can be applied everywhere\nThere is just a global namespace\nThere are no named arguments, no function signatures\nNo deallocation possible\nInefficient config file\nOperators are functions, but the function names are symbols\nNo error handling\nLack of C++ documentation (how does it work internally?)\n\nWhy this is bad:\n\nEverything is a string means that everything is executable, which can enable an attacker to execute code in some cases. Although it is easily possible to write forkbombs and other malware for cbs, this is probably not really an horror scenario, because masterlist-providers can inject code anyway. There other scenarios, where this can be dangerous: It can lead to data(=>code,state) corruption if random data is executed (just imagine a bug where someone executes a long string of human language). Such a corrupted block might even spread…corrupted code generated more corrupted code with metaprogramming. (I call this disease cubic cancer ;) ). Also it makes debugging a lot harder and even can hide bugs, this of course goes hand in hand with error handling: No error handling => no error on code corruption.\nThe problems I just described could be contained a bit if there where types and function signatures anyway (line with 8 words, can not be called for function that requires 3 args; can not call a function that requires lists for a line of human language) and again…error handling.\nNow there is a lot of problems with the seperation between data and code, but there is an additional problem: The usage of complicated string manipulation methods: You can use multiple Macros of different levels, macros are hard to distinguish from actual variables and their usage varys depending on the level of rect brackets. Calling a function seems to be equivalent with accessing the string one macro level deeper. Then there are two kinds of string defining symbols: [...] and \"...\" witch both output a string (or you can just use none of them), there are also round braces witch evaluate the code immediately. This is apperantly still a little buggy, because some strings are not recognized as entire commands and in some cases the macro modifier is not recognized (I remember, that I tried to fill a bug report about this/talk to the devs about this, I also remember that I have been somewhat unsuccessful).\n\nThe next big block of criticism is the available variable space: Ther is only the global namespace. Not a local one, no packages/namespaces, only one. In other words: You iterate over a list using I as iterator and one other function you call does the same: You are screwed. If someone else in a completely different script decides to call his var 'roster' too...you are screwed. But not only is the cbs-namespace a mess, cubescript is also one single memory leak. no RAM at all is being deallocated, try this:\n\ntestnum = 0\ntestmax = 2048\n\nbuildup = [ if (*smaller* $i $m) [ s = (concatword $s $s $s $s $s $s $s $s $s $s); i = (* $i 10); sleep 1 [ buildup ] ] ]\ntest = [\nif (*smaller* $testnum $testmax) [\ns = a\ni = 0\nm = (pow 1024 2)\nbuildup\n\nsleep 1 [ test ]\n]\n]\n\nThe code above builds string with the size of 1M and deletes it. It does that 2048 times. The memory consumption here should not be higher than 4M (this is generous). Actually it needed about a second to fill my entire RAM.\nThe next thing is that the configuration is done by writing the entire state => corrupted data and functions written.\nThe lists are bad for the obvious reason (lets append \"mapc is stupid\" to the end of a list ;) ).\nOperators are just badly designed, using symbols but the arithmetic of functions is inconsistent.\nAnd at last: There are about 5 lines of comment in the entire cube engine, maybe one in the cbs code. This makes it very hard to understand the internals, even if you can read C++.\n\nWell, I am pretty exhausted. There are some ways how you can work around this problems, I'll write them down tomorrow :) .\nYou said you think cbs is perfect for it's purpose, what makes you think that?\nCheers,\nmapc\nreply to mapc\n\nskiingpenguins | 2011-12-15 20:38\n\n\ncube script isnt supposed to be as fancy as you seem to want it. i think you should chill out, and maybe go to a different game if you want something with all these feature things. cube script serves it's purpose very well. don't mess with it.\nreply to 3starskiingpenguins\n\nmapc | 2011-12-16 01:06\n\n\n@skiingpenguins\n\nExcuse me? Do you have the faintest idea what my essay meant, have you ever spent a single thought on programming language design, have you ever thought a second about application design? Please, do not waste my time! If you did not understand what I said, that's ok. I'll even explain it to you (somewhere else), but a statement like yours is not worthy an answer and I won't feed the trolls again…\nreply to mapc\n\nChaos | 2011-12-16 02:29\n\n\nCubescript is a low-level language; hence, it's applications don't really go beyond those for which it was designed. However, in my opinion, cubescript really servers it's purpose well, accommodating a wide range of uses that relate to the game.\nreply to 1starChaos\n\nSuicizer | 2011-12-16 08:30\n\n\n? This maybe has nothing to do with your content, but CubeScript doesn't seems like a low-level programming language to me.

It's great for duels, and it's very fun as well!\nScreenshot \nGet original file (15KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThis is a small duel map, but can also support up to 6 players. Would also be fun in doubles (2 vs 2). Though, it works best with duels. This map was made yesterday and it was made in 5 hours and 40 minutes. It is a speedmap. I'd like to see others try the 6 hour speed map challenge and see what you come up with. The map was created when Superman joined Variable and myself in a game and we where making a layout together. Superman enlarged the map and started making a tiny layout. It looked interesting, but was very flawed, so Variable and myself started tweaking the layout like crazy, and it ended up being changed pretty significantly. Then everyone left and I liked the end result of our little layout that the 3 of us had made. The layout was made in 30 minutes.\n\nLater on I messaged HeWho and asked him if he wanted to do a trak5 theme speed map of a really small layout and he said yes. Then others joined in a long the way. We all worked at it for 5:10 minutes straight(some worked for 4 or so) and finally got it done. It turned out really nicely and we all we enjoyed the result. I play tested it myself and it's fun as hell. I am really proud of it and it's my second map that is pretty much completed(this map is basically done, but could get tweaked). You're probably going to say the outside terrain sucks, but the rigid terrain suits the rock texture.\n\nThere really isn't much to say about the map, it plays in duel and it's made with trak5, that's about it. I tried to balance the pickups the best I could and I think they couldn't be better; this is a biest statement of course. I hope you all enjoy it, and when you critique it, keep in mind it had a time limit and we where rushing for a lot of it. So it can't really be held to the same standards as a regular map, but certainly close to the same standards. I know it's against a Quadropolis commandment to post a map that took less then 12 hours, but I feel it's worthy of being on Quadropolis regardless. I hope you all enjoy this map, have fun!\n\nAuthors:\n\nSauce\nHeWho\nSuperman\nZoocata\nVariable-X\npotato\nNeno\n\nMap file Imminent Danger.zip (535.24 KB)\nRating\n36\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Source mod | All Platforms | Public Domain\nBlurb Blood and bullet holes don't disappear!\nScreenshot \nGet original file (57KB)\nDetailed description\n\nEver wanted to maximize the violence in Sauerbraten? Now you can with Bloody Aftermath!\n\nBloody Aftermath is a very simple source mod that prevents blood and bullet hole decals from disappearing(or at least it prevents them from disappearing in the time a game usually lasts). This can mean the map you are playing on may get covered in blood, especially in insta games! I find this adds a little extra fun to Sauerbraten.\n\nThe mod itself is an edit of the decal.cpp, which controls the amount of time it takes for a decal to fade away and how many decals can be allowed on the map at once.\n\nUnfortunately I do not have the time to compile on different platforms, so the only those with a Linux x86_64 OS can install the mod simply by using the binary I created. However, Bloody Aftermath should be able to work on any operating system that Sauerbraten runs on. Simply download the mod file, extract the decal.cpp file to the scr/engine directory of Sauerbraten, and then compile the game. Sauerbraten is amazingly simple to compile on Windows, and you don't face dependency hell when compiling on Linux. Search Google to learn how to compile Sauerbraten.\n\nBefore installing, please remember that having lots of decals on a map at the same time can lower your FPS, depending on your graphics capabilities. Right now I am running an Nvidia card with 1GB memory, and I have no noticeable slowdown. When I first tried this mod on my own months ago, I was using an Nvidia card with 512mb memory, and I only experienced minor slowdown with excessive blood(but the game was still playable. Please make a backup of your Sauerbraten folder before installing Bloody Aftermath!\n\nIf you decide to install the 64-bit binary, download the mod file and extract the decal.o file into your src/engine directory in the Sauerbraten directory.\n\nThe last thing you have to do before running Sauerbraten is you must make a few edits to your config.cfg file. The \"decalfade\" variable must be set to 1316134912, and the \"maxdecaltris\" variable needs to be set to 6000000.\n\nAfter editing and save the config.cfg file, you can now play Sauerbraten with Bloody Aftermath!\n\nKeep in mind that I am not an experienced C++ programmer, and the modification I made is very novice. Once installing the mod, the decal fade control options inside the game probably won't work for you; in order to get them back you'd either have to reinstall the game or recompile it with the original source code for decal.cpp. While my modification isn't great as far as code is concerned, it seems to get the job done. I'd like to make it so that you don't have to mess with the config.cfg file.\n\nIf anyone wants to help improve Bloody Aftermath, please let me know.\n\nUPDATE: If the decals keep disappearing, this probably means that the config.cfg file has been overwritten by the game. Sometimes this happens and I'm not sure why. Most of the time the game leaves the decalfade and maxdecaltris variables alone, but if it somehow messes with those variables, just change them back and start the game again. Making the file read-only might help, but that will also mean that Sauerbraten won't be able to save any other settings you change.\n\nMod file bloody_aftermath_0.1.zip (20.67 KB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nRed Eclipse has far more advanced gameplay mechanics than Sauerbraten has. It has many features that people initially requested for sauerbraten and comes with a bigger variety of gameplay modes. For me, this is the true successor to Sauerbraten, since it's a superior game in every respect. So i'm wondering, why do SO much ppl still play sauerbraten? When i go online, i see only 2 (!) servers with ppl on it. That pisses me off, since its such an awesome game. I personally stopped caring about sauerbraten the day Red Eclipse v1.0 came out. Maybe Red Eclipse is just badly advertised and people just don't know about it. I wonder if they would have called it \"Cube Engine 3\", more people would play it and give it the appreciation it deserves...\n\nAnother thing i've noticed, with better advertisement about the map editor i can see Red Eclipse becoming a Minecraft killer. Because ppl play Minecraft because they wanna build stuff, right? Thats exactly what they can do in Red Eclipse, plus they also get an excellent fun FPS as well.\n\n‹ Closing threads Let's talk about Tesseract ›\n\nRating\n7\npoints\n (3 votes)",

Or at least that's the humans' story, according to the aliens, we copied them. No one can be sure, but now that the Galaxies' Fair is opening in two weeks, tension is mounting and war is seconds away from breaking out...\n\nIn the past, I've made a lot of incomplete maps that I'd work on for a week and then abandon. So I decided to make a huge effort on a single map and stick with it for a long time. As you can see,it's really paid off.\nI've been working on this map for several months now, and I think it's at a stage of completion.\n\nThe layout was based on my first map Twins, but in all other aspects they are different except some textures in the old castle were used in the new one. The central catwalk area has been remade, the plain \"hidden passages\" underneath the top of the castles was turned into a full-fledged common room, the flags, bases, and ammo were repositioned, and of course one of the two castled was turned into an evil alien fortress.\n\nGoing against many recent trends, this map is intricately detailed. The downside of this is that you might need a good computer to play it. A good rule of thumb is, if you can play Skycastle-r, this map should be no problem. I've tried to keep the wtr down the best I can, (and whoever invented the \"remip\" command, THANK YOU SO MUCH!), but I haven't messed around much with PVS, just in case I need to edit the geometry further.\n\nHave fun, and happy fragging!\n\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?sea8lo2nxzbg4gn\nRating\n20\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Handicap corresponds to frag differences between players. Health, armor, damage are reduced by current handicap.\n\nHence, better players have less health, less armour and cause less damage. E.g. if you are leading with 24 frags and the weakest player has got 21 frags, your handicap is 74. Health/Armour/Damage are scaled by 74/100. It becomes harder to frag weak players and easier for them to frag you. Equal number of frags means same handicap. When 2 players with equal number of frags meet, it feels like playing normal FFA. Think of it as of the handicap in Golf. It enables people with different strength to play together and still have the same fun.\n\nIt is tested and fun. \"But I'm not good enough.

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nThis node is meant to help newcomers on their journey on quadropolis, but also to prevent people start having flamewars (or just discussions) about certain nodes or even comments. It isn't meant to thread anyone neither to refer to any happening in the past.\n\nNewcomers\n\nAs a newcomer, you probably don't know how it all works here on quadropolis. That's why I recommend you to read this guide, so you can get around more quickly.\n\nBefore creating the content\nBefore you even create a content, think about such questions:\n\nFor maps:\n01. Is the content having a screenshot which shows off a proper view of the map?\n02. Is the zip-file packaged correctly? (like \"packages/base/actually_map.ogz\")?\n03. Is it having a certain theme which can be clearly seen through other things, like texturing, geometry, lighting and detail?\n04. Are all textures fitting the geometry which they are attached to, but also fitting the theme?\n05. Could any more texturing techniques like blending, using v-commands, setting shaders, etc be used?\n06. Is the geometry fitting the theme and lighting?\n07. Can the amount of triangles still be reduced through some simple modifications?¹\n08. Is the lighting providing a correct atmosphere, which fits the expression of the map?\n09. Could any other technique be used to improve the lighting? Like using spotlights, 1 primary and 1 secondary light-entity, etc.\n10. Are the lighting errors/bugs reduced to it's minimum?\n11. Are details not being used often all around the map?\n12. Are the details having as less triangles as possible, while still looking fine?¹\n13. Is the map sealed so players can't reach specific areas where they shouldn't be? ¹\n14. Could any other technique be used to improve the flow and/or gameplay? Like using sky-textured geometry, glass, envmap-entities, etc.²\n15. Is the layout constructed so players are able to keep running in a certain pattern, for example through doorways, caves, etc?²\n16. Is the map having several layers of platforms in it's layout, which are connected to each other (by using stairs, ramps, jumppads, teleports, etc)?²\n17. Are rooms or areas containing more than 1 or 2 proper way to access and to leave?²\n18. Are the pickups and playerstarts placed for a deeper layer of play?²\n19. Could any other techniques be used to improve the gameplay? Like \"leading\" players to a certain area.²\n\n¹ Counts only for gameplay-based maps. It still gets appreciated if you would do so even if the map is notified as artistic.\n² Is completely irrelevant for artistic maps and counts only for gameplay-based maps.\n\nAs gameplay-based map are pretty easy to receive some constructive comment, artistic maps are less easy.\nWhen creating a content for an artistic map, really consider it should be artistic. Don't abuse the \"artistic\" label as your map isn't meeting some of those questions. Artistic maps should carry an even higher quality on theme, texturing, lighting and detail, so don't label it just because it's gameplay and/or flow isn't fine.\n\nFor scripts:\n01. Is the script written correctly for it's purpose?\n02. Is it having as less errors, bugs, etc as possible?\n03. Is it competitive compared to other scripts on quadropolis?\n04. Is the script written with as less code as possible?\n\nFor mods:\n01. Is the mod written correctly for it's purpose?\n02. Is it having as less errors, bugs, etc as possible?\n03. Is the mod competitive compared to the original game?\n04. Is it also compatible with other Operation Systems?\n05. Is it safe to use for other people?\n06. Are there any licensing issues which aren't fixed (yet)?\n07. Is the mod written with as less code as possible?\n\nWhen creating the content\nThe link to The 10 Sauer Commandments should give you a good view what you should not do here. And elder version of that is just right here.\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of content it is, as long as it's not even close to such questions, you can't expect the next couple of lines.\n\nAfter creating the content\nAfter you've created a content for your map, script, mod, etc and your getting a comment with feedback, always keep in mind that not even 3% of the people on quadropolis really want to insult or hurt your feelings. The comment can look very rude but think, that person probably isn't meaning it that bad, else he wouldn't have post any comment in the first place. Just read his or her comment properly and think what does that person actually mean and why is he notifying you on that certain point. Only in a few cases, the person that puts a constructive comment on your node that is generally incorrect with the content.\nNever try to insult the person which took time to look at your map, script, mod, etc as he or she probably won't do that again with the next content you create. Keep in mind also, there is a limited number of people on quadropolis and the people which truly put a constructive comment on nodes is even more rare.\n\nExperienced\n\nIf you have some more experience with quadropolis, then here is a guide how you should react on newcomer's posts, but also to any other person on quadropolis.\n\nWhen a new being has created a content which he or she is proud of (while it actually isn't looking nice at all compared to other contents), try to tell him what he or she could do better on the map. Keep in mind that person probably isn't very experienced in mapping and still is thinking on a complete different way as a more experienced person would think when he or she created a content.\nSo don't try to insult or hurt that particular person as quadropolis can always have an extra person to her collection. Maybe one day, that newcomer can help the community on quadropolis also, just like he or she has been helped in the past by other people on quadropolis.\nKeep in mind, quadropolis isn't having as much people aren't anymore as it used to have. With such comments, that wouldn't help the population at all.\n\nIf the particular person isn't a newcomer, but also a person which has more experience on quadropolis, but being outrageous, don't react on his action offensively. It often happens when people take offence as defence, a flamewar erupts even quicker. Stick to facts and investigate what he or she actually means. Just don't react on the action when it's irrelevant to the content.\nIt also isn't a bad thing to base your (constructive) comment on the The 10 Sauer Commandments, as they aren't existing for nothing.\n\nSide notes\nEven there is standing \"Newcomers\", I'm pretty sure several persons around here could use it very well, even if they are more experienced as new beings.\nI would request to any admin to star this content, so it won't be forgotten as easily as it would without.\n\n‹ terminal output of sauerbraten on linux ADD A BANNER(PSEUDO) IN REMOD SERVER MOD ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n*\n*\nStarred Content\n\nHi,\n\nMy name is Mihai Gabriel Ailioai, and i'm the developer of Marble Arena 2, a marble game based on the marvelous Cube 2 engine. I wasn't really sure if i could post any info here being that it's not one of the official games supported by this community, but hopefully it will be ok and my post won't be deleted :)\n\nIt's a very bright and colorful game, available for PC, Mac and Linux, and it keeps pretty much all of the editing power Cube 2 has, but has a layer of GUI on top so that people don't have to use the console at all, hopefully making it more newbie friendly.\nIt has 50 official levels, and we've released another 22 maps ported from Marble Arena 1, and we also have a nice little community of people creating their own levels. Nothing near what i've seen here, but hopefully we'll get there someday. It's based heavily on physics, there's no shooting or killing, although we have a nice lightning bolt shield powerup that could slightly impress the killer in you :)\n\nCheck it out, you might like it, and who knows, maybe even be convinced to create some levels for it :P\n\nwww.marble-arena.com\n\nEdit: March 1'st 2012\n\nNew version released. It includes 32 new levels, autosave and ability to customize controls, and what was requested the most around here: working console and custom scripts.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Alpha | Content | All Platforms | Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA)\nBlurb A replacement of models used in gameplay.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (584KB)\nDetailed description\n\nEven this looks pretty simple, I've spend pretty much time in this actually.\n\nContent information\nThe goal of this enhancement is to make pickups fit the atmosphere of any particular map better (by rendering the skybox or any envmap-entity on the mesh). For most maps, the skybox matters a lot for which expression the atmosphere gives players, so that's why it would be a logical choice.\nAll pickups (except health and armour) are using bump-mapped skins with masks modified for envmap-rendering. The teleporter has been replaced for and old but enhanced cube teleporter, as it displays envmaps better (the inside is just flat, which supports envmap-entities because of that) and Sauerbraten's original teleporter is copyrighted.\nThere are some doors included which are also polished a bit, but those are actually just an experiment (it still creates some nice atmosphere when an envmap-entity is in the same room as the door).\nThe health model isn't included, as using a bump-mapped skin somehow blackens the upside of the model. The armours aren't included because envmapping them has no reason at all (too much polygons to see any clear environmental-mapped rendering) and bump-mapping the skin isn't showing much difference at all.\n\nUser-related warnings\nThis is a replacement of the current and original models. If your not satisfied with the result, there is a folder called \"default\" which contains all files which were overwritten (so beware, any new file of this content keeps existing!).\n\nUser-related notifications\nThe flags are currently carrying environmental-mapped rendering, even it's also just an experiment (not recommended to add).\nTo let bump-mapped skin of the carrot work; delete the original mesh (called \"tris.md2\"). Trust me, it's worth it.\nThis pickup-mod is meant to keep as much models which are currently in the official release as possible (as reason not to change anything to the current gameplay intentionally).\n\nCopyright notifications\nAll modifications to masks, meshes, skins, etc are licensed as BY-NC-SA, else they are copyrighted by it's original author.\n\nI hope you enjoy them, any constructive comment is welcome.\n\nMod file pickups_enhanced_4feb12.zip (2.46 MB)\nRating\n50\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I'm new to these forms so at this moment I don't have alot going on here.\n\nAnyways I have plans to build a new kind of Operating System which I call L-Core.\n\nBase off of Linux Mint and gnome modified with the help of remastersys, and some reconfiguring to function as its own operating system as a concept of a future OS that I like to make anytime soon.\n\nThe Real credit belongs to the people that build the programs\nand the whole source code. I only change some configurations and put them together.\n\nSo heres what I'm going to do with this. I'd like give it a new kind of desktop environment that can possibly replace gnome and yet it uses alot less resource power than gnome 3 KDE and Unity. But ever since I found out about This game I had some plans to use cube script as another part of my OS. So heres what I'm trying to say. how would you like to see your own maps being used on a desktop background using compiz holding ogz files along with other formats from blender and many others? Well I certainly do to further cube mapping skills and putting those awesome looking maps in use instead of having it lying around not being usable unless you used the game to even view the maps. As much as it goes with usability and compatibility this may also further more cube development and possibly invent something completely different from whats normal.\n\nOther than cube related stuff it will also serve other prepossess for beginners, gamers, Artists, business application to advance users like programmers, white hat hackers, and even industrial hardware uses and many more to come.\n\nI hope to have something like this In my next release L-Core BIO v1.1 when its possible.\n\nright now this is how far I gotten in my OS so far so get this link to see what I did so far.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-9td0oVmqI&feature=channel_video_title\n\nand here are the plans\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROWh3Btpnt4&feature=channel_video_title\n\nTill then this is LR7 Logging out\n\n‹ Kill Strike Rewards [REQUEST] IQM exporters and Blender 2.60 ›\n\nRating\n20\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I looked to see if someone had done a glass model shader but could find none. I experimented for a long time (had a lot of fun) but didn't get anything to look how I wanted. So my questions are:\n1. is it possible?\n2. has anyone done it? (and know a link)\n3. if it can be done, but hasn't, can anyone point me in the right direction.\n\n‹ Sauerbraten Moderators?

I think Flock games also had an Xbox game based on the cube engine. Does anyone know how they did this? I don't think MS provide openGl support on the Xbox at all, so I am guessing but they would have to either have to write a wrapper to intercept OpenGL(and SDL) and turn them in a DX9 functions, or they recoded all the OpenGL/SDL code in cube to use DirectX/direct draw libraries.\n\n‹ Cube 2 based game: Marble Arena 2 Would You Need Specil Programs For..... ›\n\nRating\n5\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

This script gives you complete control of your gamehud; it allows you change all of the colors, change the order, change the labels, etc... There is also the DuelHud feature, as in the previous version. With this, you can customize a second gamehud that will appear each time you are engaged in a 1-on-1 match. This gamehud can optionally display your duel status. The two other features that have been carried over are the Continuous Echo (echo your duel status at an interval you define) and the Echo on Keystroke (echo your duel status with the press of a key you define). There are more detailed instructions written in the included GUI, which is bound to key 'L' by default (or alternatively, you can simply type /duelscript in-game) - just navigate to the \"Help\" tab. I have kept the old version up just in case some of you like it more, which I highly doubt would be the case. As for the future, I'll try to reduce the number of variables that this script uses, perhaps by merging some of them into lists. Please let me know if there are any issues, or if you have any general comments. Note that it is recommended that you don't run this version and the prior version simultaneously, as it could cause some problems.\n\nConfig file duel.cfg (16.52 KB)\nRating\n20\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

However while I can edit maps and add \"/newents\" and whatnot, I am stuck with a few problems\n#1 INSTALLING MODS\nHOW DO I DO THIS?!?!?!?! (I downloaded the popular hellpig2 mod, and it works just fine) but as for hudguns, when I replace the original guns with a new modded one, in gameplay a yellow version of the normal guns appear on everyone else, and I just see empty hands in front of me. Please tell me how to correctly install mods.\n#2 IDK\nWhen you do damage to some one (e.g., one pistol round to a hellpig) a little '25' will float up, or whatever number it is. I understand what it is, but is there any way to turn them off?\nI would be incredibly ecstatic if anyone could help me with either of these problems.

More diverse, more tactical, more... friendly? Look no further.\n\nYou don't necessarily need to be a Brony to appreciate this mod. (I don't really consider myself one). I've tried to make these voice commands as useful on the battlefield as possible, and they can can be perfectly relevant in casual conversation even if it has nothing to do with ponies. Alone in enemy territory with the flag? Press X-F-4 for Fluttershy saying \"I need your help\". Newcomer derping around? X-D-6 gets \"Careful, Derpy!\". Just trounced a foe with your accurate SMG skills? X-P-6 makes Pinkiepie exclaim, \"Holy moly, that's a lot of hole-ies!\".\n\nAlso includes the CSI Miami sample of Won't Get Fooled Again (\"YEEEEAAAHH!). Not that Horatio makes a cameo, I just thought a decent voice chat mod should have it.\n\nUPDATED JUNE 16th:\n-11 New sounds: \"CHAAAARGE!\",\"yay\", \"you rock! woohoo\", \"FOREEEEVER!\", \"eeyup\", \"gotcha\", \"the fun has been doubled!\", \"my bad\", \"I just don't know what went wrong\"(both original derpy, of course), \"OH COME ON!\", \"Mwahahah! You can run, but you can't hide!\"(Queen Chrysalis).\n-Text has the same color as the pony saying it (all subtle colors) and includes image of pony for the mane 6 (only other people with the mod can see it tho)\n-New artwork\n\nMore information, as well as a complete list of sounds, can be found here.\n\nHave fun!\n\nMod file Friendship is Tactics.zip (2.51 MB)\nRating\n20\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This file is not packaged properly due to it containing files that have no place in a simple map package. It is provided as an example and a prompt for feedback. It is not considered a playable map, but developer experimentation.\n\nContents:\n\ncanyon2.ogz\ncanyon2.cfg\ncanyon2.jpg - files for example map\n\nlightmap.cpp\nblend.cpp - modified source files from SVN, December 2011 (I think)\n\nsauerbraten-test.exe - Cube 2 compiled for win32 with new commands.\n\nheightmap.blend - blender file used to render heightmap from level geometry\n\ncanyon2.txt - this text file\n\nTo extract the blendmap from the example map, load the map and use exportblendmap at the console. It should export the blendmap much like a screenshot.\n\nNew settings and commands:\n\nsunlightspread - size of the sunlight disc in degrees - larger values make for softer lighting.\nsunlightiterate - number of samples to take for each sunlight beam. This slows lightmap calculation quite a bit. 10 seems to provide decent quality.\n\nexportblendmap - exports a 8-bit greyscale png of the current blendmap to Sauer's base directory.\nimportblendmap - imports a 8-bit greyscale png from Sauer's base directory. The image must be the proper size for the map scale of the current map. I recommend making a blendmap in the normal way, exporting it, and using that as a template for an image to import.\n\nMap file canyon2.zip (6.56 MB)\nURL http://www.xoltan.org/files/canyon2.zip\nRating\n9\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nI recently heard about Tesseract, which from what I heard is a modification of Sauerbraten that uses all dynamic lights and directional model lighting. However, I also heard that it requires a really good computer and it has trouble rendering maps with a lot of lights, and since the rendering approaches are so different maps with lots of lights will simply be unplayable.\n\nHere's an article: http://freegamer.blogspot.com/2012/04/tesseract-cube2-next-gend.html\n\nSo what I'm wondering is, what's the future of Tesseract? I really want to see this mod go places, but I don't want to have to give up all the graphically-intensive maps.\n\nAlso, even though I'm not a huge fan of Minecraft, this mod pretty much paves the way for a free, open-souce Minecraft with graphics a million times better than the original. An even cooler idea might be to somehow combine Sauer with Minecraft's buildability, so you can have deathmatches with destructible environments where you can build up defenses. (It might not even be as far-fetched as it sounds, there's already a Minecraft map importer on the Cubic Matter forums.)\n\n‹ Why do people still prefer Sauerbraten to Red Eclipse?

After finishing the map, eihrul came up with the name \"outpost\" and the maptitle \"Martian Outpost\", which fits the theme well, i think.\n\nGametypes.\nThis map is made for duel/ffa/insta. I prefer playing duels on it, 4 players should be the very maximum.\n\nLayout.\nI made a more or less traditional pit-like map. Orientation should be pretty easy. The ledges and rooms arranged around the pit have different levels though to make it a bit more interesting. Most of the boards, slides and crates do actually have a function for movement/jumps/shortcuts. Take some time to discover possibilities to bunnyhop and weaponjump, in my opinion the flow is pretty good.\n\nWeapons & Playerstarts.\nThere are narrow and more open places/long sights. So every weapon got its use on this map. There are 3 shells, 3 rifles, 2 grenades, 2 bullets and 2 rockets. I put all those weapons right in the middle of the rooms and platforms, easy to pickup, so players don't have to run into walls/cramped corners or jump on small ledges just for a simple weapon-pickup. There are 12 playerstarts spread over the map. They are all close to weapon-pickups, so players can get hold of a first weapon within one single step/jump, so they cannot get spawnraped that easy.\n\nItems.\nI experimented a lot on this one and finally came to the conclusion, that a \"complex\"-like itemset (all 3 big items, few health) is more interesting than a \"douze\"-like itemset (one big item, lots of health). So i decided to use quad and boost and the yellow armor, but only very few health-items (2). So players do not constantly recharge health and they actually die, when getting shot. Also the gameplay is not only focused on 1 single big item. Quad is placed in a risky and relatively difficult to reach place, so I think it's not overpowered.\n\nGeometry.\nAll in all rather simple. I tried to repeat the same rounded forms in different variations. Besides that there are some pipes, crates and ramps. I know there could be more geometrical detail and the 'round cubes' could be even more round, but i tried to have an eye on filesize and performance also. Keep in mind, that this is not an artistic, but a duel-map. Nieb came up with the idea of altering the height of some of the roofs/buildings. I experimented a little bit, but dropped the idea: the lightning/shadows changed too much and the walls looked to high and a little boring.\n\nTextures & details.\nSame as above. I decided not to use too many textures and mapmodels/particles. I always liked the visuals of \"complex\" and \"academy\". So i mixed them up a little. Thanks to suicizer for the idea of blendmapping the floor and adding some random, broken stuff.\n\nLightning.\nSkylight, Mars-skybox and a sunlight-entity with a little red touch. A little fog. That is basicly it. I just put some lights in some rooms/corners, that seemed to dark to me, and some little lights in front of the tech1soc/032lig12ya texture.\n\nClipping.\nEverything except the roof (and roof-constructions) is accessible. You cannot fly/fall out of the map. Besides that I clipped/noclipped some corners/trims and spaces to improve the flow/jumps and erase some camping-spots, which would definitely make gameplay worse. Thanks to suicizer and razgriz for showing me, how to nearly properly clip raound stuff with the skytexture and alpha-cubes. I hope it feels natural and flowy.\n\nPerformance & Filesize.\nThe .ogz is around 1000kb big (or small). The wtr-value says something like around 37k. Around 14500 lightmaps. On my 4-year-old macbook the map runs stable at 125fps (with shaders turned off). With the helping hand of RaZgRiZ (Thanks!) I tried to skytexture as many unseen faces as possible to reduce lightmaps. Unfortunately there are still some unseen faces left non-skytextured. Skytexturing them somehow causes light-errors on the seen faces right next to them (e.g. the broken parts of the floor). So I left them textured normally.\n\nBots.\nAs you can see, a waypoint-file is included. It's working, but sometimes the bots get stuck under the centered ramp or the ramp at the yellow armor. The only way to avoid that would be clipping the space under the ramps, what i do not want to do. so, I have to live with that.\n\nLicense.\nIf you want to use work with/on this map, just ask me, before doing so.\n\nThanks.\nEveryone, who gave me feedback on quadropolis.us, irc or ingame and helped to improve this map. Especially suicizer, razgriz, nieb, eihrul and all cm|members.\n\nContact.\nrabe, #hypertriangle on quakenet\n\nMap file outpost.zip (954.38 KB)\nRating\n84\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

So I decided to make it happen.\n\nAs some of you may know, Red Eclipse has the option of removing the gravity in maps, although it hasn't been used much. Now I have. And it's awesome.\n\nThis map isn't an exact replica of the Battle Room. There are four rooms with flags at the top around a two-story central room with a gravity machine. To get to the enemy's flag, you start out going down, but then you have to go though the central room and then up.\n\nI found out that you can simulate gravity with pushers, so there are places in this map where there is gravity, and to find out where just listen for a humming noise. The spawning rooms have gravity, but as soon as you drop through the one-way energy membrane, you're floating free. The machine in the central room also generates a weak gravitational field near the top, but it's more like on the moon than on earth.\n\nThe \"gravity\" and \"aircub\" vars are stored in the map, so you don't have to fiddle with anything to play. Just remember: although, unlike in the book, you can control where youu drift, you move slowly and it's hard to change directions, so parkour really is your friend here. Also, since the aircurb value is higher, you can get a lot of momentum going.\n\nFor more info, visit the Red Eclipse forum at http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=53.\n\nMap file Battleschool.zip (4.57 MB)\nRating\n32\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nYes! So im new to sauer.. and new to the community, but i just want to inform everyone on a new game mode i've thought about.\n\nThe Game Background\n\nSo the game mode would involve a variety of different contestants with one goal..TO SURVIVE. However, this will prove to be a difficult task because weapons, along with health and Armour are limited and rare. Spread across a medium or vastly large map different items are kept in secret caves, tunnels, etc. waiting to be found. In order to survive the players must form alliances and take down other enemies because if they do die, they will not re-spawn back, which adds more suspense to the game of course. I also forgot to mention that their is only one winner. I REPEAT, ONE WINNER!\n\nHow the Game Would Take Place\n\nEach game would start off with a certain number of people..say 15-24, more or less. At the start each player will be spawned onto a starting point. While at the starting point each player will await the countdown and be informed of rules and orders. (At the beginning of the game each player with be equip with chainsaw only.) Some of these rules are: They must wait for the countdown before advancing into the map. No re-spawning after death, which im sure can already be scripted. ( NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE ) not entering into edit mode.\n\nAfter the countdown is done and all the players are out in the map gathering guns and equipment, anything is a go to survive. You may be a lone ranger and survive by yourself or decide to take your chances with teaming up with someone(s). Either way you must always remeber only one ay survive.\n\nIF ANYONE LIKES THE IDEA AND WANTS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, OR IF YOU WANT TO SHARE SOME ADVICE PERHAPS, POST HERE AND LET ME KNOW!!

    "title": "Home ~ Forums ~ Content Creation ~ Source Engine (SMD) Hudgun Export Tutorial!",
    "author": "jbo1994 | 2012-05-31 22:47",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Content Creation\n\nIn this tutorial, I will attempt to clarify the process for setting up for and exporting hudguns with hands for Sauerbraten and Red Eclipse.\nYou will need Blender 2.62 and SMD tools, which can be obtained here and here, respectively.\nI will not provide instruction for the actual modeling process, only for rigging, exporting, and configuring.\nNow, I’m going to assume that you have fully skinned hand and gun models for exporting; if you do not, this tutorial is going to be useless. First, rig the model. Select the model that you are going to rig, then select the rig, and press ctrl-p [with empty groups] and assign the vertices of the model to their proper groups. Make sure to keep gun and hand armatures separated:\n\nBy jbo_aka_jnosko at 2012-05-31\n\nNow, add a bone to the hand armature, name it “tag_weapon”, and parent it to some bone in the hand holding the gun by selecting first the tag_weapon, then the bone to be parented to, and pressing ctrl-p. Mine is positioned here:\n\nBy jbo_aka_jnosko at 2012-05-31\nAs you can see, the relationship line goes to the tip of the wrist bone in the right hand.\nNext, align the gun and hand models as they would appear in the first frame of the “idle” animation. After you have done that, add a bone to the gun armature named “tag_weapon”, and align this bone with the tag_weapon of the hand armature; parent it to the root bone of the gun.\nfor example:\n\nBy jbo_aka_jnosko at 2012-05-31\nPlace a bone at the end of the barrel or the tip of the blade, facing the direction of the projectile, name it “tag_muzzle”, and parent it to the root bone of the gun also.\n\n-FOR RED ECLIPSE USERS ONLY:\nIf the weapon you are working on ejects brass (such as the SMG), you will need a bone named “tag_eject” at the point of ejection.\n\nFor the rest of you: Make sure that the origins of the gun armature and model are at the root of the tag_weapon of the gun armature. Put the hand armature in pose mode by pressing ctrl-tab. Select the gun armature and then select the tag_weapon of the hand armature; press ctrl-p [click “bone” in the menu]. This will make it easier to animate the hands and the gun working together.\nProceed with animating the hands and gun, making a separate action for idling, firing, (and reloading for RE) in the action editor, using separate actions for the hand and gun armatures.\nNow we’re ready to export. go to the scene tab of the properties panel, and scroll down to the SMD export section. Set the output folder to “//smd//” f.e. “//smd/shotgun/”. now, select the gun armature, close the action that is assigned to the armature (to avoid duplicates), and then also select the gun model. Duplicate the selected items by pressing shift-d. Select the original gun armature and also the hand armature, and press alt-p [clear parent]. Take the original gun armature and model, snap the cursor to center with shift-s [cursor to center], and snap the selection to the cursor with shift-s [selection to cursor]. Align the tag_weapon to the global x-axis, then rotate with [r, x, 90, -] and then [r, z, 90]. (I also suggest that you set the origin for the hand model and armature at the center, but it's not mandatory.) Then proceed to scale the models WAAAY down, so that a long gun is about 2 blender units long. Otherwise, the point where the projs begin will be way too far forward.\nGo back to the smd export panel and make sure the only the original hand and gun meshes are selected to export, and click “scene as configured”. Now, select only the original hand and gun armatures, making sure that the your “idle” animation is assigned to them. Go to the smd export panel and make sure the ONLY the original armatures are selected, and select “current/NLA” in the drop-down list for each. Press “scene as configured” again; repeat with all the other animations. (you may be able to use “action filter” from the list in the smd panel, but I’ve never tried it.)\n\nNow to import them to the game. I recommend using the same set of hands for all of your guns, so that the game will only have to load one set of hands for all of the weapons.\nFor sauerbraten, create a folder in packages/models for your hudguns, and make the folders chaing, shotg, rl, gl, chainsaw, rifle, and pistol inside that. Place the exported hand model, animations, and skins inside the root hudguns folder; place the weapon models, animations, skins, and configurations inside their respective folders.\nUnfortunately, these will not show up in team games, as I have absolutely no idea how to assign different skins for different teams. Also, if you decide to switch back, you will have to delete Sauerbraten’s configuration file. Otherwise, the default guns will be horribly disoriented, and I do not know why.\nSample configuration for Sauerbraten: (for more info on commands, see “models” in the documentation)\nsmddir \"\"\nsmdload \"hands.smd\"\nsmdpitch \"\" 1\nsmdtag tag_weapon tag_weapon\nsmdskin * \"hands.png\" \"hands_mask.png\" .4 .1\nsmdadjust Root -5 -7.5 0\nsmdanim \"gun idle\" \"hands_chaing_idle.smd\"\nsmdanim \"gun shoot\" \"hands_chaing_fire.smd\"\n\nsmddir \"\\chaing\"\nsmdload \"chaingun.smd\"\nsmdtag tag_weapon tag_weapon\nsmdtag tag_muzzleflash tag_muzzle\nsmdskin * \"chaing.png\" \"chaing_mask.png\" .3 .2\nsmdanim \"gun idle\" \"chaing_idle.smd\"\nsmdanim \"gun shoot\" \"chaing_fire.smd\"\n\nsmdlink 0 1 tag_weapon\n\nFor Red Eclipse, things must be done differently. First go to the “models\\actors\\player” folder and make a backup of “hwep.cfg”. Then make a backup of the entire “weapons” folder. Delete the “md5.cfg” inside the “hwep” folder of the weapon you are currently replacing. Place only the weapon files in the hwep folder, along with configuration in the form of a “smd.cfg”. Now go back to the player folder and replace the original “hwep.cfg” with your own; place all of your hand files here.\nsample configuration for the weapon:\nsmddir \"weapons/,/hwep\"\nsmdload \".smd\"\nsmdskin * \".png\" \".png\" .09 .06\nsmdenvmap * \"skyboxes/skylump2\"\nsmdtag tag_muzzle tag_muzzle\nsmdtag tag_weapon tag_weapon\nsmdanim \"\" \"_idle.smd\"\nsmdanim \" primary\" \"_fire.smd\"\nsmdanim \" secondary\" \"_fire.smd”\nsmdanim \"\" \"_reload.smd\"\n\nmdlscale 1680\n\nsample configuration for hwep.cfg:\nsmddir \"actors/player\"\nsmdload \" hands.smd\"\nsmdpitch \"\" 1\nsmdskin * \" hands_skin.png\" \" hands_mask.png\" .2 .4\nsmdbumpmap * \"spartan_hands_normals.png\"\nsmdenvmap * \"skyboxes/skylump2\"\n\nsmdtag tag_weapon tag_weapon\n\nsmdanim \"switch|use|jam\" \"hands_switch.smd\"\n\nsmdadjust Root -5 5 0\nsmdanim \"smg\" \"hands_smg_idle.smd\" 1\nsmdanim \"smg primary\" \"hands_smg_fire.smd\" 20\nsmdanim \"smg secondary\" \"hands_smg_fire.smd\" 20\nsmdanim \"smg reload\" \"hands_smg_reload.smd\" 51\n\nsmdadjust Root -7.5 5 0\nsmdanim \"rifle\" \"hands_rifle_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"rifle primary\" \"hands_rifle_fire.smd\" 120\nsmdanim \"rifle secondary\" \"hands_rifle_fire.smd\" 120\nsmdanim \"rifle reload\" \"hands_rifle_reload.smd\" 70\n\nsmdadjust Root -2.5 5 0\nsmdanim \"flamer\" \"hands_flamer_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"flamer primary\" \"hands_flamer_fire.smd\" 20\nsmdanim \"flamer secondary\" \"hands_flamer_fire.smd\" 20\nsmdanim \"flamer reload\" \"hands_flamer_reload.smd\" 10\n\nsmdadjust Root -7.5 2.5 0\nsmdanim \"shotgun\" \"hands_shotgun_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"shotgun primary\" \"hands_shotgun_fire_alt.smd\" 53.3\nsmdanim \"shotgun secondary\" \"hands_shotgun_fire_alt.smd\" 53.3\nsmdanim \"shotgun reload\" \"hands_shotgun_reload_alt.smd\" 45.75\n\nsmdadjust Root -7.5 2.5 0\nsmdanim \"pistol\" \"hands_pistol_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"pistol primary\" \"hands_pistol_fire.smd\" 260\nsmdanim \"pistol secondary\" \"hands_pistol_fire.smd\" 220\nsmdanim \"pistol reload\" \"hands_pistol_reload.smd\" 56.25\n\nsmdanim \"grenade\" \"hands_grenade_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"grenade power\" \"hands_grenade_power.smd\" 19\nsmdanim \"grenade primary\" \"hands_grenade_fire.smd\" 240\nsmdanim \"grenade secondary\" \"hands_grenade_fire.smd\" 240\n\nsmdadjust Root -7.5 7.5 0\nsmdanim \"plasma\" \"hands_plasma_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"plasma primary\" \"hands_plasma_fire.smd\" 240\nsmdanim \"plasma secondary\" \"hands_plasma_fire.smd\" 220\nsmdanim \"plasma reload\" \"hands_plasma_reload.smd\" 26.6\n\nsmdadjust Root -5 7.5 0\nsmdanim \"sword\" \"hands_sword_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"sword primary\" \"hands_sword_attack1.smd\" 66\nsmdanim \"sword secondary\" \"hands_sword_attack2.smd\" 106\nsmdanim \"sword reload\" \"hands_sword_reload.smd\" 40\n\nsmdadjust Root -5 2.5 0\nsmdanim \"rocket\" \"hands_rocket_idle.smd\" 0\nsmdanim \"rocket primary\" \"hands_rocket_fire.smd\" 240\nsmdanim \"rocket secondary\" \"hands_rocket_fire.smd\" 220\nsmdanim \"rocket reload\" \"hands_rocket_reload.smd\" 26.6\n\nmdlscale 1680\nProceed to make a backup of your hwep.cfg and weapons folders. That way, all you have to do to switch back and forth is replace hwep.cfg and the weapons folder.\nThere. You’re all set to play Red Eclipse with your own guns.\n\nBy jbo_aka_jnosko at 2012-05-31\n\n‹ Few Questions For Creation Zombie War Script? ›\n\nRating\n20\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nAgain we have nearly managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory! We really need some help with this MD5 exporter for Misfit3D that we developed which works almost perfectly. For windows there is a recompiled binary with the exporter rolled in and for the Linux version of Misfit there is a plugin.\n\nAt present the exporter works perfectly for the mesh and the animations. You export your model by selecting \"Export\" or \"Save As\" and typing .md5 or .md5mesh as your file extension. The exporter will then produce a xxxx.md5mesh, a xxxxx.mdanim for all animations and a prototype md5.cfg. If the animations are named they are spat out with that name. If they are not named then you get one, very big animation file with them all in. Best to name them first! It is very efficient if you name them first.\n\n**** Updated ****\n\nOne of the tags problems was due to space names in the models bones. This is a big no-no.\n\nThe most important thing is you must NOT use the Misfit tags. If you use the tags the md5 model will stuff up. Read the wiki and download from the sourceforge site - http://sourceforge.net/projects/misfitcubed/\n\nWe have a battle armor model - http://teamxbow.org/cube/models/misfit/battle_armor2_v04.zip and a human walker mek http://teamxbow.org/cube/models/models-mek/mek6_v04.zip that are in Misfit format and the animations are set up ready to export.

    "author": "CD Xbow | 2012-06-14 02:16",
    "image": null,
    "content": "General Discussion\n\n\"Gamers seldom make passes at players with classes\"\nDorothy Parkour\n\nThis is the first formal announcement of the release of MekArcade 0.4 this August. We are calling this 0.4 release the 'Developers Edition', because we need your help taking it further (mappers at the ready!) and we still haven't decided if this should be a public release or just within the Cube community. You can see some pictures and an old vid at the http://www.moddb.com/games/mekarcade, and you can keep up with our plans at the SF site. While it is really only about half done, it is in fact fully functional - one of the benefits of forking from a working cube engine game like Red Eclipse. Now the spruiking is over......\n\nThe first major change to the RE code base is the implementation of a player class. Indeed you can think of MekArcade as RE + playerclass + Mek content + a few other bits and pieces. Quin has done a splendid job implementing 'cube with classes'; and it is classes I want to talk about, as there are many potential uses for a player class, and quite frankly I don't think I have the wit to think through all the possibilities. I also feel we have a significant responsibility to do this right. Obviously it makes class based games possible like TF2, and vehicle games of all types, implementing special class based abilities (eg the light engineer mek will be able to carry stuff) and will also aid us in building defensive weapons. I am sure there are many of you with your own thoughts about classes and what could be done with them, please share.\n\nCurrently the player class is simple and there only a few attributes at this time, below is the relevant code:\n\nconst char *classmodels[NUMCLASSES][3] = {\n{ \"actors/mek1\", \"actors/mek1/hwep\", \"mek1\" },\n{ \"actors/mek2\", \"actors/mek2/hwep\", \"mek2\" },\n{ \"actors/mek3\", \"actors/mek3/hwep\", \"mek3\" }\n//{ \"actors/mek4\", \"actors/mek4/hwep\", \"mek4\" }\n};\n#else\nextern const char *classmodels[NUMCLASSES][3]; //3\n#endif\n#define CLASSES(a,b1,b2,c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) \\\nGSVAR(0, class##a##name, #a); \\\nGVAR(0, class##a##health, 0, b1, VAR_MAX); \\\nGVAR(0, class##a##armour, 0, b2, VAR_MAX); \\\nGFVAR(0, class##a##xradius, 0, c1, FVAR_MAX); \\\nGFVAR(0, class##a##yradius, 0, c2, FVAR_MAX); \\\nGFVAR(0, class##a##height, 0, c3, FVAR_MAX); \\\nGFVAR(0, class##a##weight, 0, c4, FVAR_MAX); \\\nGFVAR(0, class##a##speed, 0, c5, FVAR_MAX);\n\n// name health armour xrad yrad height weight speed\nCLASSES(mek1, 300, 80, 3, 3, 15, 200, 65); //80 recon flyer\nCLASSES(mek2, 400, 100, 3, 3, 15, 300, 50); //50 base beholder medium\nCLASSES(mek3, 330, 90, 3, 3, 15, 250, 60); //70 light engineer ?carry health\n//CLASSES(mek4, 500, 100, 3, 3, 15, 350, 40); missile mek\n\n\nFor the 0.4 release we will have 4 or 5 classes, some very similar to TF2 classes. (Why not!) Jumpjets and hover should be attributes of a class by release time.\n\nThe 0.5 release later in the year should bring in a destructible entity, next gen weapons, possibly defensive weapons. Underpinning this will be a change to using multiple weapon tag points. There are a few implications for this in terms of modelling (the weapons will make up part of the mek shape), the weapon management will be less FPS like.\n\n0.6 will bring in a Mek/heat cycle like MekAssault had, and a few other bits and pieces that got missed in 0.5. At that point the MP game, as planned, will be mostly be in place, and we will then decide whether we need to continue to develop the MP game play further in 2013 or work concentrate on single player.\n\n‹ how do i use mods Hej! :D Im new :D ›\n\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

Otherwise this won't work.\n-Description is lengthy so stay with me here.\n\n(Screenshots do NO justice)\n\nThis mod introduces a multikill system into Saurbraten. Just follow the directions in the \"READ ME\" file for installation instructions.\n\nNow, about the mod:\nThose of you familiar with Halo will recognize and hopefully love this addition to the game. I really feel like this is a much needed touch of depth added to Cube.\nAfter killing an enemy, you will have 5 seconds (as a default) to kill another. When you kill two enemies you earn a \"Double-Kill!\" and you'll hear a bad ass voice announce \"Double Kill\". If you kill ANOTHER enemy after your double kill, you earn a \"Triple-Kill!\". And again, you hear the awesome voice announcing your accomplishment. You get five seconds between every kill to earn the next medal in line.\n\nHere's a list of all the Multikill medals\nKills.........Medal\n2........... Double-Kill!\n3........... Triple-Kill!\n4........... Over-Kill!!\n5........... Killtacular!\n6........... Killtrocity!\n7........... Killimanjaro!\n8........... Killtastrophe!\n9........... Killapocalypse!\n10........... Killionaire!!\n12.......... Onslaught!\n14.......... Bloodlust!\n16.......... Berserker!!\n18.......... Vendetta!\n20.......... Secret\n22.......... Secret\n24.......... Secret\nThey all work, and they all have voice overs ^^\n\nSome stuff you should know::\nContrary to what you might think, multikills after about 5 or 6 are HARD to get. BUT.... it really is a lot of fun trying to reach the highest multikill and hear the last two announcements. You don't get anything in return... but it's fun :P\n-Also, the font in the screenshot is not included in the mod, NOR does it even matter what font you use.\n\nI really hope you all enjoy this and use it, add to it, modify it, whatever. This is my first mod and I DO plan on further releases of this script and stuff.\n\nBIG thanks to SomeDude for holding my hand through making this and teaching me how to do it! I really appreciate it. Pretty much all the credit for that script goes to him\n\nP.s.\nIf you wish to know how to change anything about this mod, ask!\nP.P.S.\nIf anyone would like to make a video displaying this system working, it'd awesome. My computer isn't good enough to record and play at the same time. Screenshots really do NO justice.\n\nMap file packages.zip (5.61 MB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "Quin | 2012-06-21 08:22",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Guide\n\nFrom: http://qreeves.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/understanding-open-source.html\n\nAs the developer of the Open Source first-person-shooter project, Red Eclipse, I have come across many different types of personalities; some are good, some are bad. Quite often, I will have someone looking to contribute to the project who is so convinced that their point of view is so important that it only ever ends badly. Unfortunately, you can’t control this kind of thing, but in the past I have attempted to guide these people along the right path, albeit unsuccessfully most of the time.\n\nI believe there is a misconception surrounding the phrase “Open Source”, that many people bang against and wonder why they’re met with such hostility. When a person decides to release their creations with an Open Source license, their desire is most often always to share it with the public in many ways, including allowing everyone to use and/or modify it for free.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the expression, “Free as in beer, not free as in speech”, but maybe don’t quite understand the implications of that. The creator of Open Source content is looking to give you something for free, and quite often allows you to take it and do whatever you want with it; the most beneficial part of which is the ability to study, modify, and play with it. This creator already has their own ideas, their own opinions, and their own way of doing things.\n\nEvery so often, you have an individual come along who has their own ideas and opinions, and they are so fixed on the concept that their way is the right way, they end up having a complete disregard for the creator, and the community behind that creation, if one exists. These people will enter a community, demand that everyone conforms to their vision, and when they discover the creator and/or community are resistant to it, blames everyone else for the fact that they failed. This often ends with the person declaring something along the lines of: “I should have known better, you don’t appreciate me, I’ll go elsewhere and get my way there.”\n\nThe problem is, these people don’t ever try to integrate with a project naturally, they appear to expect instant results as soon as they come along, and assume they know everything they need to know. This is mostly untrue. Throwing a tantrum and refusing to share your toys is the best way to ensure that everyone will instantly dislike you. To them, they were doing just fine before you came along trying to shake the tree and making demands of them, and they will continue to do just fine without you.\n\nOpen Source is a democracy of one. Someone, somewhere up the chain, came up with the idea and executed it. They built it, and they own it. Just because they have given something to you free of charge, does not entitle you to start telling them how to do their “job”. You’re not paying them, in fact, they’re giving up their free time to follow an idea that they are passionate about, and it is just a side effect of generosity that they released it for everyone to enjoy. Too many people think that Open Source bestows a right of ownership on them, but if you ever read one of these licenses carefully, all a creator is giving you is the right to use, distribute, and/or modify it.\n\nSo, if you’re looking to contribute to an Open Source project, now or sometime in the future, try to remember this: You are a guest in someone else’s home, please respect them and the work they have done. Try to understand their vision and their rules, get to know the way they operate, find out if they’re even interested in your ideas. If you approach them with a good understanding of their work, you’re more likely to get the result you are after, or maybe even find some other way you can fit in.\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nThis idea was suggested a while ago on the Red Eclipse forum at freegamedev.net. I'm also discussing it there, but I realised this could also apply to Sauerbraten.\n\nHere's the idea: a variable called \"vcurb\" or \"vslide\" that could be used like \"vrotate\" and others. This variable would scale the slipperiness of the surface a player is standing on, like Red Eclipse's \"floorcurb\" var, but applying only to certain surfaces instead of the whole map. (note that \"slipperiness\" in this case only applies to momentum, not to how easy sloped surfaces are to climb or slide down.)\n\nThe main discussion on whether I should pursue this for Red Eclipse is in the link above. The purpose of this forum topic is mainly to discuss whether the Sauer community would like this to be included in Sauerbraten as well.\n\n‹ Hej! :D Im new :D Can you use a gamepad in CUBE 2? ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

A secret organization was working on a developing an improved version of revelade, and they succeeded.\n\nUnfortunately, the organization was infiltrated and the drug was stolen. Every government agency in the world was put on high alert. Little did they know that the drug was highly contagious and was already being distributed in the water reserviors of every major city in the world.\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the world as we know it was over. Nuclear weapons became in fashion, hundreds of cities were destroyed, but to no avail. The virus had already spread into the majority of human population and it was just a matter of time. Everyone knew apocalypse was near.\n\nThe human gene had degraded so much that every human being on the planet turned into a zombie, well almost everyone. There was small group of survivors who called themselves The Forgotten Ones, these survivors seem to posses immunity against this virus, but no one knows the secret behind it. Now their duty is to withhold their bases long enough for them to regenerate and create an immune generation which in turn will take back the world and restore the human civilization to the way it was.\n\nAre you up to the task of saving the world?\n\nWeapon Features:\n\nPrimary and Secondary Weapons – All weapons in-game (except for chainsaw) have a primary and secondary weapon attack mode making game play that much more interesting.\n\nRocket launcher – Direct fire rounds and guided missiles\nFlamethrower – Blast fire which does damage over time and can be used as a jetpack\nPistol – Single shot and 3 shot burst\nShotgun – Buck shot and grenade launcher\nGrande launcher – bouncing bombs and landmines\nSniper rifle – Long range shoots and exploding bullets\nCross bow - Long range shoots and bouncing circular saw blades\nAssault Gun - Raid fire in a large area and controlled stream of bullets\nHealing Gun – Heals team mates and does damage to non team mates\n\nClasses: Revelade Revolution also offers different player classes. Each class offers their own weapons as well as health, armor and speed buffs.\n\nOffensive– Sniper rifle, Shotgun, Chainsaw. Health 100, armor 50, max speed 100\nDefensive– Rocket launcher, Assault Rifle, Chainsaw. Health 120, armour 60 max speed 95.\nStealth– Flame Thrower, Crossbow, Chainsaw.

We feel that our game is at a point now that game play itself is good and our features are bountiful. What we need is people interested in revamping exciting maps or creating new and exciting ones.\n\nWhats in it for you?\n\nBesides the feeling of joy and warm fuzzes that a map you made is in a game you will also get credit on our games \"Read Me\" and a \"Thank you\" in game item (We are working on a few ideas).\n\nWhat we need\n\nIf you have played RR before you will see that we have many different game types (Capture The Flag, Free For All, Co-op Survival and more). What we are looking for is either maps designed for one of these game types or they can be maps that are designed for more then one type. We are looking for detailed and quality maps that will provide hours of game play for everyone.\n\nGot an idea for a mod instead of a map?\n\nThat's great too! If you have an idea for a game mod or enhancement feel free to upload it here to indiedb and we will try it out. If it is something we like then we will include it in the next official release!\n\nURL http://www.indiedb.com/games/revelade-revolution\nRating\n82\npoints\n (10 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Adding commands /getteamkills and /getsuicides which work the same way as commands /getfrags, /getdeaths, etc...\n\nThe scoreboard:\n\nExplanation of colors:\nThe number of frags is displayed in cyan if it is greater than or equal to yours (yours will therefore also be in cyan), others are blue.\nThe Deaths are in red.\nThe KPD is in magenta.\nThe Accuracy is yellow.\nThe Flags scored are green.\nThe Teamkills are in pink.\nThe Suicides are in orange.\n\nBut : the scoreboard was further amended, the following changes:\n-> During a game, you can see only kills, Accuracy and flags of each player.\n-> At the end of the game, you have the frags , the deaths, the KpD, the accuracy , the flags, the teamkills and the suicides.\n\n-> A flag symbol appears beside the name of the player carrying the flag. Small preview:\n\nBut in order to see these flags symbols you need to download these and to get them in the proper folder :\nhttp://ompldr.org/vZWh0eA/packages.zip\n(Thanks to RaZgRiZ for the symbols, see his all package here http://www.quadropolis.us/node/3402)\n\nAlso note that the values ​​of the Accuracy, Deaths and KpD are counted from the moment you arrive on the server, so if you come in the middle of a game, the values ​​will be wrong.\nThis problem is unfortunately impossible to correct, I should change the server side code.\n\n-> Addition the scores of the teams below the mini-map (or top right when there is no mini-map) :\n\nOn this screenshot, you can see small blue dots on the mini-map. Those are the positions of teammates. This may be added in one of the next versions of the mod.\n\nAnd last thing in the v2 :\nAddition of the \"mini scoreboard\", this is actually a list of connected players (without spectators) to the right of the screen. This list is very useful in clan war: the name of players are in blue or red if they are in your team or not. When the player is dead, his name goes grey, and at the left displays a countdown of 5 seconds, also in blue or red depending on the team. The countdown stays at zero until the player did not respawn.\nNames are aligned on the left, the longest name comes exactly at the edge of the screen to the right.\nThis list is optional: /playerslist 1 to enable, /playerslist 0 to disable.\n\nOn this screenshot you can see there is a big space between my name and other names.\nThis is due to the fact that spectators are not shown, but there is a blank instead of their names. Problem might be solved in a next version.\n\nThis work is always in progress, more changes will be added.\nFeel free to make comments, ask questions or tell me any bug or problem you encounter.\n\nURL http://servers.cube2.fr/downloads/SauerFR-v2.1/\nRating\n38\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I released it under the ZLIB License, because it only uses resources found in the official Sauerbraten release (please correct me if I'm wrong on the license).\n\nI made a blog to document my progress more in-depth, which I listed as the project URL.\n\nI welcome any comments or suggestions! If you would like to help work on the map or improve it, please contact me first, and I will give you more details. I prefer to continue using only the official Sauerbraten resources (objects, textures) to keep the map development as smooth and streamlined as possible.\n\nAlso, this is just a map. There will be no player interactions or Pokemon-styled gameplay, at least until I have the entire map completed, so please don't ask questions like \"How are you going to catch Pokemon?\" or \"How are you going to implement the fight system?\" because I'm not planning on doing any of those things.\n\nI'm trying to make the map as close as I can to the original Pokemon maps, I am using the Kanto maps from the Red/Blue games on strategywiki as a source. Also, I'm trying my best to make it realistically scaled, so that if I ever want to make a SP map out of it I can.\n\nI welcome feedback!

Because of the complexity of the city paths, teams prefer caves for fast infiltration of the enemy's side and easy way back to their own base. But city's numerous crooks and squares are perfect for unseen incursion to the enemy territory and shaking off pursuers afterwards. Also, when you are making your way through the city, watch out for snipers on roofs of the city's many buildings and towers. There is a railway bridge leading from one side of the city to the other. The bridge is a perfect way to cross the city effectively. However, there is a safety forcefield in the middle of the bridge, so you must leave the bridge there. If you see an enemy behind the forcefield, don't think you're safe - bullets can pass the forcefield easily. Teams have managed to break into two of the towers accessible from underground caves. Towers contain stairs to the surface and a unique way of getting almost to the top of the city canopy.\n\nThat's what this map is about - caves, complex paths (getting lost), jumping between the roofs... That's why it's named Urban Mine (filename is just \"mine\").\n\nThis is the very first map I ever published, hopefully more will be coming soon.\n\nA bit of map info\n\nGamemodes: primarily Regen capture and Instagib Flag modes\nPlayers: As much as possible, should be at least 8. Game with less player would be probably boring.\nLicense: CC-BY\nAuthor of the map: Lord Kv\nAuthors of the textures and sounds: Lunaran, Rorshach, Mayhem, Blindabuser\n\nSpecial thanks to my brother for advices.\n\nMap is curretly in BETA, so I will be still making changes to it. Main thing I'm not sure about is capture bases' positions. Feel free to create your own bases (NOT flag bases) and remove my own capture bases. Then you can tell me your own bases' positions and how you liked them.\n\nHope you like and enjoy it, thanks for playing!\n\nI'm sorry I forgot, I inspired in map Metl4 by Metlslime.\n\nBeta 1.1 CHANGELOG\nThanks P1nokjo for helping me find errors\n\n-wider stairs\n-wider paths from small squares to stairs\n-fixed missing light and dark areas\n-fixed clipping\n-better stairs\n-some models were replaced with cubes\n-fixed texture errors\n-added new path to flags\n\nMap file mine11.zip (3.47 MB)\nRating\n22\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nI made a new gamemode for Red Eclipse a while ago called (Secret) Killer Mode. In this gamemode, there's one Killer that has some resistance to damage and tries to frag as many other players as possible without getting caught. Eveyone else is a Citizen, and they have to find who the Killer is without killing other Citizens. The Killer gets points whenever a citizen dies (including if the citizen was killed by another citizen), and the Citizens get points for fragging and/or damaging the Killer. I currently have a server up (sometimes) that uses this mode.\n\nI decided that I should port this to Sauer, but there's one problem: I used a server varable called \"killeractivated\" to turn the mode on and off (and several other vars to adjust the gameplay), but I haven't found any equivalent in Sauer that isn't client side (which would mean players would have to download a modified version of Sauer to play this gamemode). Is there any way I can make a server variable that turns the mode on and off, or will I have to overwrite normal gameplay so that Sauerbraten always plays Killer Mode?\n\n‹ Server Mods/scripts/Commands?

I tried contacting him, but without success. So about a year ago, just as a project for myself, I decided to finish it.\n\nI added more pathways connecting the two bases, added items and waypoints, enlarged the hallways, added some crates for cover, drained most of the pool,and added access to the surface. The finished product is a deathmatch/CTF map that's tight and close-quarters, but with tons of different paths and copious amounts of cover. (I find it works better as a Team Death Match map, though)\n\nAnyway, I was keeping this map to myself for a year in fear of the deadly Ambiguous Licencing Ninja Squad, but now I think the community should have a chance to see it, partly because I haven't contributed much to Sauer since Rivals.\n\nPlease don't hate me.\n\nOrignial: http://www.quadropolis.us/node/998\n\nMap file crashed-finished-by-greaser.zip (6.5 MB)\nRating\n29\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "ThomasT | 2012-08-19 02:56",
    "image": null,
    "content": "Help and Support\n\nI am attempting to understand Sauerbraten's mod development model. First, I have successfully compiled and run the Justice Edition and latest svn release of Sauerbraten as well as Tesseract, all under Mac OS X Snow Leopard. (Compiling and modifying the svn release has some issues on the Mac that I've solved but won't go into here unless someone would like to hear about them.)\n\nNext, I've attempted to understand how source mods are made. I found http://cubeengine.com/forum.php4?action=display_thread&thread_id=1592 (\"[MODDING] Your first Sauerbraten MOD, Tutorial 1\"). It goes into great detail, describing how to create a new Sauserbraten mod by copying fpsgame, changing the makefile, etc. It then says to specify -g[modname] to execute the mod. However, the Sauerbraten configuration page (http://sauerbraten.org/docs/config.html#_minus_gn) says the -g option is used to specify the maximum number of bots a master can add to a server.\n\nOn the third hand, single stepping through the code leads to the argument parser in main() (i.e. SDL_main()) in engine/main.cpp). The parser indicates that the -g option is used to specify the log file! So it looks like the code, configuration documentation, and tutorial all disagree with each other.\n\nFurthermore, after examining the included Makefile it looks like rpggame is not included, in disagreement with the tutorial. I've searched quadropolis for source mods, and it looks like every one at least that I could find just modifies the base source files and distributes the modified files in the mod. I've also done other fairly extensive searches of the web and have found no other information, except maybe a few other pages that say to specify the -g option to execute a mod.\n\nFurthermore, the Mac OS X launcher internally sets the -grpg option to go into the (unused) rpg game code. I hacked the NIB file to actually exercise this path, and not unsurprisingly a log file called \"rpg\" was created in the user's default directory, sigh, and the rpg game code was never executed.\n\nLastly, after some more single-step spelunking and code analysis, I see that the game code is specified in the game namespace. This is true for both rpggame and fpsgame. What that means is (obviously) only one or the other but not both can be compiled into the code.\n\nSo of course what has happened is the source code has evolved to the point that it is out of sync with some code, documentation, and tutorials. Unfortunately this means it is all but impossible to discern the proper model for source modding the game engine at this point.\n\nSo could someone please provide me with some historical perspective on this (since I'm new to the forums)? Also, some guidance as to the proper current way to create and distribute source mods would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n‹ Decal Texture Mystery Server Mods/scripts/Commands? ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I heard it was possible, and knew it was possible. But every tutorial i read on hosting was dedicated to Windows and Linux, and only had a little side note on Macs. The other hosting tutorial had mac instructions, but i found them not to work for me. I do not know about you guys, but then again, it did not work for me!\n\nFirst, drag Sauerbraten.app to your computer's Applications folder.\n\nNow, create a folder called \"sauerbraten\" in the hidden /etc/ folder.\nNext, now open txt editor (or the program you prefer) and in the text\neditor put:\n\nmaxclients 20\nserverbotlimit 5\nserverdesc \"Server Name Here\"\nadminpass Password\nservermotd \"Motd Here\"\n\nNow save this as server-init.cfg (YES IT NEEEEDS TO BE .cfg FILE!)\n\nNow place this in the /etc/sauerbraten/ folder.\n\nNow, from the command-line, run:\n/Applications/Sauerbraten.app/Contents/MacOS/sauerbraten -d -k/etc/sauerbraten\n-R3@per\n\nTHIS IS ONE COMMAND, THERE IS A SPACE AFTER THE -D AND NO SPACE AFTER -k/etc/sauerbraten !\n\nI believe you can add what ever mod you want, you just put it in the /etc/ folder as the cfg, then just do -k/etc/sauerbraten. To find the /etc/ folder just go into finder and search for etc, it's file path should be library/private/etc, you must have admin account AND know your password to authenticate for /etc/ to be modified. If it doesnt let you then click Authenticate when it gives you the can not be modified message!\n\nI hoped i help some of you guys out there, and if any of you need help just comment (and i will answer) or ask on teamlol.clanteam.com (not advertising :D) OR email me... if all else fails, at fetzernoah@gmail.com!\n\n‹ Auth?

Gathered information for everyone, wrote website and now looking how to do get started with Phase 1!\n\n9.9.12, 16:00 CEST: updated the description!\n\nsigned and love,\nvice-president meow! (*~*)7\n\nA little never old story...\n\nOnce upon a time...\n\n... in a small and unconspicious industry area, there was a president whos car broke down, out of reasons we might never know.\nSo he and his bodyguards were stranded at this remote location, some sort of garagebunker! Cut off of the world, with their brand new rental car only 2 minutes away... BUT HOWEVER...\n\nTHE PLACE WAS COVERED WITH ASSASSINS! =O\n\nThe bodyguards saw this, confered and decided to do the only right thing: to protect their prez with their lifes! through vents and warehouses, and narrow street canyons over a dangerous button and a loooooong, last, open yard into safety!\nBut nothing would be that easy anyway... o.O\n\nThe fights were rough! Their nerves were raw! The prez was shaking, huddeling behind crates and in dark corners where the assassins wouldn't find him. And it took his bodyguards a whole day and a lot of bandages to finally get him through this madness into safety! 0.0\n\nAfter this dark, dark day, the president decided he would never forget this day of horror. And he filed a law, that this forsaken industry area would for all times fall to ruin.\n\n13 years have passed by now. Grass and little trees grew out of the gaps into the streets, the warehouses were partly reclaimed by nature. Everything looks so peaceful and safe now... HOWEVER...\n\n... as life plays its mysterious ways, the prez, just on this very today, happens to be around the area again. Visiting his old grandmother (again!), who is in a dying condition (AGAIN!! =O), and all of a sudden...\n\n... his motor starts to spit. o.O\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n(on a homage-to-the-hunted-server near you!! xD)\n\nThe Teams\n\nPlease step a little closer and meet the protagonists of this meaningful day!\n\nTeam 1.) - The President!\n\nShort: the prez. A man, only armed with his word and a chainsaw (which he has swaped against his umbrella since the last fatal meeting) and a gun he forgot to load! If it was up to him, by the end of the day, not a scratch will be on his suit!\n\nTeam 2.) - The Bodyguards!\n\n- Heavily armored guys with gattling guns, being as big and slow as their brains are!\n- Athletic soldiers, equipped with bazookas and shotguns! Always there to shoot their prez up vents and beat the shit out of those assassin creeps! (if necessary! o.O)\n- Medics, giving their misanthropic lifes to protect and heal their prez + a shotgun (for selfdefense only, of course =P) (how we gonna make those will stay a riddle to me o.O)\n\nTeam 3.) - The Assassins!\n\n- ice cold snipers, only equipped with their diligently polished rifles and chainsaws (they too have learned something since back then! =P)! They know how to hide at places that about no one else can reach! And with bloodshot eyes they want to see only one dead thing at the end of the day: an innocent prez! =O\n\nSay what?!?! o.O\n\nIf you have ever played Team Fortress Classic (short: TFC, or TF 1.5), which was originally an official update to Half-Life 1 and is the father to Team Fortress 2 (TF 2), you might know the incredibly fast paced map and game variant \"The Hunted\".\n\n\"Homage to The Hunted\" (working title) is a Cube 2: Sauerbraten-rebuild in honor of this epic adrenaline rush of a map and gamestyle, just set 13 years into the unimagined future of an alternate universe! xD\n\nThere are different routes through the map that might lead the president to safety and lots of hiding spots, to be used by the assassins as well, who also have additional areas only they can access (or if you're a really skilled soldier =P).\n\nWith Team Fortress 2 the developer Valve decided to refurbish The Hunted out of the game, and re-invented it with the Payload gamestyle instead, where a wagon needs to be escorted along a fixed route. There is a fan based Hunted mod for TF 2 however, with an engeneer as the civillian, and in this cute TF 2 cartoon style, but it's impossible to play on older PC's. Also one might argue why spies and pyros have to be in there. o.O\n\nSauerbraten is just destined to revive this classic with its cubic but tremendously better graphics and fast paced gameplay!\n\nHomage to the Hunted is free software under the GNU GPL v2 license and so will all its addons be (like scripts and models (if they ever should be)). But due to the nature that it should be a very close replica of the original, fast paced, with no lag on slow PCs, with all the physics, jump locations, etc, but at the same time working naturally within Sauerbratens world, I've decided to only work on it with a handful of dedicated people, to enhance my mapping experience as well as to finish it more quickly.\n\nIf you are interested to join, and to work yourself into the original (or have even played it!), have suggestions or ideas what to change, please write us in the comments or visit us on the server. I'm not fixed to the GPL v2, but it needs to be a free and open source software license.\n\nlove and signed,\nvice-president meow!

(*-*)7\n\nIf you'd like to help with scripting the conditions for Homage to the Hunted (be it a simple master-script or even more), or would love to do something unique like designing a run down version of the original warehouses and places, and are dedicated to recreate an epic game, please let me know! :D\n\nMy ideas for realization so far are:\n\n1. - Basic and cheap, but quick and easy!\n\nCreating the map:\n- Phase 1 - revival <- WE ARE HERE! xD\nThe map will be built as a very close replica of original tfc Hunted: everything as cuby and oldlooking as it used to be. Made to honor the legend and to playtest it. Just, as there are no crouching positions in Sauerbraten and there is this different point of view and physics overall, the size of the map may have to be made bigger. All piggyback and rocket jump positions, every shooting the prez up vents, all hiding spots behind crates, etc, will need to work.\n- Phase 2 - polishing\n2nd Version of the map will then be based on 1st, just that it will bring more detail: the original lighting but also enhanced 3D-structure to everything: the containers, crates, buildings, ... to make it Sauerbraten worthy.\n- Phase 3 - ruining\nIt will then be ruined by nature and us. Some walls and roofs will have cracked up or broken open, wooden crates moved, fell apart or began to rot, grass and other plants grew, as well as trees at some unusual places, creating unusual hiding spots. There will be puddles and mud pits, and maybe new ways, or a somewhat blocked old one, and probably some evidence of the devestation that happened to the original hunted! xD\n\n-- Number #1 goal is to keep the cubecount low, and the framerate up on old PC'S at all times, though! o.O xD --\n\nStarting conditions:\n- One way doors to protect Team 3 (Assassins) respawn from being ambushed by the bodyguards\n- Sniperrifles and a Quaddamage at Team 3 respawn\n- Bazookas, Machineguns and Shotguns at 3 new, separate playerstart-areas at Team 2 (Bodyguard) respawn, (near Team 1), one way doors here too.\n- as well as 3 Healthboosts at Team 1 (President) respawn (up at his lift, where only he can reach it)\n\nmanual Gameplay-rules:\n- at the beginning of a 15 minute game the players have to select the related playermodel (e.g.: President: Inky, Heavies: Ogro, Soldiers: Captain Cannon, Medics: Mr. Fixit, Assassins: IronSnout X10K)\n- they then need to pick up their related weapons /and armor at their starting position.\n- A round is decided when\n  a) the president is assassinated or time runs out or\n  b) the president captures the flag from right tower (as replacement of the switch to open the garagedoor to safety), and enters the nearby garage with it where he scores immediately.\nProblem with this: CTF is only 2 teams - if it would be possible, anyone of Team 2 could score also.\nBenefit: you could see if he really made it by his teams scorepoint and notify sound, his starting location would be reset also.\n\n2. - Great enhancements, but would need a good scripting effort:\n\n- Players need to pick their team/class from a menu before the game starts / team 2 (bodyguard) is also able to change their class during the game, but will then respawn at starting point. (and / or master sets random teams button).\n- Weapons and ammo count are given to each class, there is no extra ammo.\n- Medics can drop 5 health cartridges and up to 3 health boosts within a given time.\n- Prez has no weapons but the chainsaw and a pistol with 2 shot ammo.\n- no \"friendly fire\"\n- Round is won after someone pushed switch up on right tower, then prez enters garage within 10 seconds.\n- If Team Prez dies or time runs out: win for Team 3, siren and restart all\n- If Team Prez escapes: win for Team 1 & 2, cheering and restart all\n\n3. - Fantastic addons, but would take incredible effort (+maybe impossible =/):\n\nmaking it a mod (might never gonna happen):\n- medics have a new weapon: return of the Original Medkit!! xD and can heal and \"overheal\" up to (e.g.) 200 health which will go slowly back to 100\n- When in zoom-mode, Assassins can charge their rifles with holding left mouse for at least 5 seconds - this will slow them down, but releasing upon target usually inflicts instant death.\n- this charged rifle aim would be seen by everyone as red spots on the map. (possible?)\n- custom player models with team colors for the bodyguards, a custom suit for the prez and camouflage for the assassins.\n- new, free texture set\n- return of the crowbar. (& umbrella! xD)\n\nDownload and set-up Homage To The Hunted!\n\nOur map comes with a htthunted.cfg config that is a new menu on your F8 key. It helps us to answer FAQs (frequently asked questions) and provides other useful help and settings for editing in game. Please feel free to tell us what you would improve, or even do it yourself! It's free software either! :D (and as that it is derived from the official Zombie-Apocalypse Menu).\n\nOur homage-to-the-hunted.zip includes:\n- homage-to-the-hunted.ogz - our map: Return of the Hunted / Homage to the Hunted / Hunted... whatever =) name to be decided yet. hehe\n- homage-to-the-hunted.jpg - a preview loading picture of the map\n- homage-to-the-hunted-GPLv2-license.txt - a copy of the GNU General Public License (Version 2)\n- htthunted.cfg - our Hunted-Menu for F8 (no other keys are bound, and it only works if you activate it first!)\n- (soon: a readme)\n\nHow-to extract / set-up everything:\n\n(note: when asked to overwrite older files, please say yes (it will only replace our old files) - (see last time of zip-update, if needed)\n\n- Linux:\n1.) download the homage-to-the-hunted.zip to your home directory (important!)\n2.) open up linux console (terminal) and copy (ctrl+c) and paste (ctrl+shift+v) this into it:\nunzip homage-to-the-hunted.zip -d ~/.sauerbraten/ && echo exec htthunted.cfg >> ~/.sauerbraten/autoexec.cfg\n- If you are extracting the zip for the second time, you only need:\nunzip homage-to-the-hunted.zip -d ~/.sauerbraten/\n3.)

Yes, this is a complete make-over of the original capture_night. Features a lot more camping and obscurity which is sure to challenge people. The size is exactly the same as the original but a lot more cover has been cramped in and more ways of moving around have been introduced.\n\nThe map is partially complete, as the flag room is still a placeholder for something better. Suggestions are welcome.\nI would also like feedback regarding ammo placement. It may be too much, but it guaranteed i always had something to shoot with. I've also included some crude waypoints for the bots to move on. They like getting stuck in weird places however, so keep that in mind.\n\nIn the next update (which will hopefully be soon enough to catch up with the release before it happens) i will introduce some more fixes to texturing, clipping, and hopefully do something nice with the flag room.\n\nSo enjoy and give me lots of hate, i need it at this point.\n\n--- UPDATE 1 ---\n\nUn-nerfed the balcony jump\nReduced the amount of grenades drastically\nLengthened the map a little to avoid 4s flagruns\nNew flag route that's guaranteed to be a hard one\nRemoved smaller trees and replaced with ^\nSome exterior torches, minor lighting/texture updates\nReplaced healthboost with quad damage\nMap file twinforts.zip (2.18 MB)\nRating\n116\npoints\n (14 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Red Eclipse | News\n\nThe Red Eclipse Team is proud to announce their new release, version 1.3 codenamed \"Galactic Edition\".\n\nThis release sees a semi-stabilisation of the gameplay in favour of implementing a variety of bugfixes and user requests. We've removed some old cruft and implemented a few new game types to replace them, like coop (humans fight high powered bots), and king-of-the-hill (control and defend one flag). Due to the popularity of the impulse/parkour system we have introduced a new \"impulse vaulting\", where you can hold down your parkour key to \"vault\" over low obstacles, making it that much easier to navigate around busy levels.\n\nWe invite you to download it and give it a go, each release brings us that much closer to a polished game. If you have any feedback, feel free to visit our forums at http://www.redeclipse.net/forum and let us know what you think. We're also still looking for a new trailer to be featured on our home page, as the one we are using now is 4 releases old! If you think you can help make a professional video, check out the thread on our forums: http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=2237\n\nWe hope you enjoy playing this game as much as we enjoy creating it. As always, you can download Red Eclipse from our website: http://www.redeclipse.net/\n\nFull Post: http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=3443\n\nlogin to post comments",

The most significant new features are:\n\nGlyph mapping (supports mapping of glyphs from multiple fonts).\nDigit-only output, to help create the hud capture digit glyphs\n(packages/hud/digit_{blue,red,grey}.png and packages/hud/digit_font.cfg).\nColor PNG support (with and without alpha), including support for custom\ncharacter foreground and background colors. (This is needed to\ngenerate the digit glyphs.)\nSupport for negative inborder and outborder values. (Negative inborder\nvalues provide a simple way to \"bold\" a font.)\nOptional fatal error on missing glyphs.\n\nMinor new features:\n\nAbility to explicitly set the font name in the config file.\nAbility to force a font to be of fixed width.\nNoexec mode (useful for automating font processing, to weed out fonts\nwith missing glyphs for example).\nVersion display (including copyright) with --version.\nAlternate font packing algorithm. The original algorithm can be used by\nspecifying the --sauerpack option. (This is provided for comparison purposes.\nThe intent is to delete the old algorithm after others have tested the new one.)\nAdditional error checking and reporting, especially for Free Type errors.\n\nThe package includes cube2font-enhanced.c and a detailed README with examples and instructions on how to build. Note that no new dependencies were introduced, so you should be able to build this new version by just replacing the current cube2font.c and using the existing build method.\n\nMod file cube2font-enhanced.zip (22.02 KB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

The NoobLauncher ships with new plugins: hudstats, fullscreen, letsplay, masterserver manager, grenade launcher, ragequit and cubetris. Most existing plugins got new functionalities and guis were improved, too. Also there were much work under the hood: NoobLauncher now supports Sauerbomber and the SVN version of Sauerbraten.

Those frameworks are repackaged in this package.\nThe Justice Edition contains an uncompiled MainMenu.nib that is a drop in replacement for the SVN MainMenu.nib. Again, it is simply repackaged in this package.\nLauncher.m is modified to only show the Cocoa startup window if the command key is pressed at launch.\n\nImplementation Details (Launcher.m):\n\nThe changes to Launcher.m are very very minimal:\n\napplicationDidFinishLaunching is changed to applicationWillFinishLaunching. This avoids the brief flicker of the Cocoa window being quickly displayed and hidden.\ntestNoLauncher is changed to detect if the option key is pressed during startup:\n\n        NSUInteger flags = ([NSEvent modifierFlags] & NSDeviceIndependentModifierFlagsMask);\n        BOOL modifierKeyPressed = (0 != (flags & NSCommandKeyMask));\n        if (run || !modifiedKeyPressed)\n        {\n            // [...]\n        }\n\n\nBuild Instructions:\n\nReplace the existing src/xcode/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib with the one in this package.\nReplace the existing SDL_image.framework, SDL_mixer.framework and SDL.framework in src/xcode/Frameworks with the ones in this package.\nReplace the existing src/xcode/Launcher.m with the one in this package.\nBuild as usual.\n\nNote: Before replacing any of these files, you should make backups of the originals, and also verify that the SVN versions haven't already been updated with these or similar fixes, or have other changes.\n\nMod file MacOSXBuildAndStartupFixes.zip (2.11 MB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Conceptual | CTF | Medium (5-8) | Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA)\nBlurb A map that tests a possibly interesting idea that I had.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (458KB)\nDetailed description\n\nOne day a while ago, I was looking through the Sauerbraten game files, and I found something that I found interesting. In Sauerbraten\\src\\fpsgame\\ctf there's a line:\nstatic const int HOLDFLAGS = 1;\nI interpreted this to mean \"A player can only hold one flag at a time.\" I do not know if that is what this line of code actually means, but i don't think it pertains to Hold gamemode, because that uses capture bases.\nRegardless of its actual meaning, it got me thinking. Can a team in CTF have more than one flag? If not, why specify how many flags a player could hold? I had to test this out.\nTo that end, I made a CTF map where each team had two flags. The map itself was almost a flat field, nothing interesting about it. However, I figured out a few things:\n-Yes, a player can only hold one enemy flag at a time.\n-You can score by bringing any one enemy flag back to any one of your flags, regardless of whether your other flag or the enemy's other flag is safe.\nAnyway, that was a while ago. I moved on to other things, but soon came back to the idea. I wanted to make a viable map with two flags for each team. I drew ideas, I started on a map. Then I stopped, because I had started to make an incredibly elaborate map, which in addition to two flags, had altogether too many paths and was built mainly on a diagonal, requiring structures to be built at 45 degrees to normal orientation (very annoying). So I abandoned that idea.\nA few days ago, I wanted to examine the idea again, but I no longer had the original map file on my laptop. The solution, build the double-flag test map again.\nThis time, the map approaches something much closer to playable. It's not very pretty, and I made no attempt to make any of the ceilings in the tunnels high enough for jumping, but unlike it's previous version, this map has some actual cover and scenery, and enough ammo to support an actual small match. Playing (with bots) on this map, I found out something else that I suspected:\n-You cannot pick up more than one of your own team's flag in Protect gamemode.\nSo anyway people, here is a conceptual map exploring an idea I had that, with a good design, I think could work well. The possibilities are very intriguing, it would certainly make CTF and Protect more exciting. (Protect especially - I've found Protect to normally be low-scoring and boring)\nWhat do you think?\n\nNote: I know that this map is not very good, the (possible) value here is the idea, making a map was mainly to show the idea in action. (I think that just posting the description in the forums wouldn't have been as useful for exploring the idea, with this map, interested people can in just a couple minutes see the idea for themselves instead of making a map themselves if they wanted to test it out.) Please do not viciously attack the map, because I already know what's bad about it!\n\nMap file duotest.zip (377.61 KB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

By using heat-lamps and fans, the ogros, fixits and ironsnouts managed to keep certain places warm enough so they won't be frozen, as it would be an even tougher job to navigate.\n\nI've tried to use several gibbie and lunaran textures to create an original look, but also to give the feeling you're not on earth anymore. The ice and snow are just to prevent a boring look and could be a nice addition to the theme. But that brings me to the following question (if you'll look into the map): Do you have any ideas to add even more details? Because I'm kind of out of ideas for a certain amount of time already. Please put them in your comment if you have some, I'll be pleased to hear about it.\n\nThe layout is meant to have a certain x-axis gameplay (so not just flat aiming) and is a little less open as most duel maps. But if you use your eyes, ears and mind, you'll be able to track your opponent in no-time and blast or shred him into pieces (as the middle wall is actually the only visual obstructive). You could keep this in mind: if you can't see your opponent, he probably is located at the other side of the map.\n\nFeel free to leave a (somewhat constructive) comment somewhere on this content.\n\nCredits\nI would like to thank Rorschach for the custom texture.\n\nMap file icecube_5nov12_v2.zip (732.02 KB)\nRating\n17\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I've created this remake with the intention to offer a pretty playable map for Sauerbraten which is open, but providing enough cover while not being just flat (as the map contains out of 3 stages) and the intention of giving some sort of attention for another great (free!) game next to Sauerbraten, Open Arena.\nA bigger, more detailed screenshot of the map is right here.\nI've created just some quick-made video about the flow and look of the map for the people which are desperate to see the map, but not having SVN. It's obtainable right here.\nThe map can also be played in hold or capture, with the same ammount of people.\n\nI'm not really planning to redo the texturing, but if people really insist doing so (and bring some nice arguments about it), then I'm open for feedback on that.\n\nFeel free to leave a (somewhat constructive) comment somewhere on this content.\n\nCredits\nI'd like to thank Yves Allaire for the decal-textures which I've (mis)used as glow-mapped textures and Hans \"pulchr\" Litgard for the original pul1ctf map.\n\nImprovements\n19th of November 2012\n- Added trims and light-sources to the blue base also.

I spent quite some time creating an environment outside the actual fighting area to not give the player this feeling of just being caught in a small \"fragging-box\" with nothing around it.\n\nskrdm1 was originally meant to be just a duel map, but since I like duels where you also have a chance to escape from your enemy and its not all about aiming, i made it a little larger than the usual 1 on 1 maps. If you are playing in insta or prefer \"faster\" games, it can be played with up to 4 people (and also in capture or even hold).\nThe map consits of three floors (and the HP boost), that provides some vertical gameplay what i generally missed in sauerbraten. It might take you a couple of minutes to get used to the layout, but you'll find out that it's pretty flowy (in my opinion at least.. ^.^)\n\nHappy fragging!\n-Skur\n\nUpdate v1.1 (22-11-2012)\n- added more dirt\n- added missing waypoints\n- added more playerstarts (there are 16 now)\n- added 4 more lights\n- fixed geomtrie errors\n- fixed clipping\n- fixed some details\n\nUpdate v1.2 [FINAL RELEASE] (29-11-2012)\n- fixed texture errors\n- fixed teledest\n- added missing terrain\n- updated mapshot\n\n22k WTR\nFile size: 1.2 mb\n\nMap file skrdm1_v1.2.zip (1.2 MB)\nRating\n126\npoints\n (13 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

We were editing together and decided to make a playable map and the rough draft of the layout was born. It was pretty rough, but we began to see that it was a great sketch and that it would turn into a quality map. I do not remember how the theme was chosen, but it is similar to rm5 and masdm (two maps in svn that we had worked on in the past) and I view it as somewhat of a mixture of the two, with improvements on both.\n\nThe map itself is a medium sized map, fit for around 4-8 players, but you could use it as a duel map if you like. FFA, Collect, Capture, Effic, Insta, and Hold (possibly?) are suggested game modes. There may not be enough ammo, but I considered it sufficient. Pretty light weight in wtr, so it should run pretty well on most computers.\n\nThis is (hopefully) the final release of this map, but I would be overjoyed if you were to comment any suggestions or thoughts you have on the map.\n\nSpecial thanks to: ac for helping start this, Chris_0076 for his wonderful realistic lighting job, and the rest of cm|CubicMatter for the help and inspiration.\n\nUpdate: Added some weapons, added healthboost, moved health, changed clipping, updated waypoints, top of depot center is now playable, moved some weapons, changed tele, moved some boxes, added trim to all of map, and fixed up some jumppads.\n\nUpdate 2: Fixed clip and trim.\n\nUpdate 3: Fixed more trim and other small things.\n\nUpdate 4: Fixed trim, texture errors, (no)clip, waypoints, bases, collector-placement, and lights.\n\nMap file packages.zip (1.62 MB)\nRating\n25\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

He told me I would have to hurry and recommended me to conscript several editors to help me on that map. So did I. Hewho, Cooper and even Eihrul worked together with me on this map.\n\nThe map itself is very huge for normal conditions, huge enough to fit for over 20 players. The recommended gamemodes are Capture the Flag and RegenCapture.\n\nWe have tested this map with around 8 players, the gameplay was fun and everything worked like a charm.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Final Release | Capture | CTF | Huge (16-32) | Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA)\nBlurb Two flags per team - A realized test of an old idea\nScreenshot \nGet original file (527KB)\nDetailed description\n\nA while ago (a few months) I posted a map illustrating an idea I had; multiple flag CTF. Many people made good suggestions for how to improve upon the concept. This map is the result.\nEach team has a main base with five exits (four teles and a drop out), ammo, and armor. The four flags are at the four ends of the main cross of the map. Each team base is between its two flags. This map is quite large, intended for ten or more players per team.\nFor people who may not have read my previous node, you can score an enemy flag at either of your flags, you don’t need to have both of your flags safe to score, you can only carry one flag at a time. You don't need to change anything about your game files for this map to work properly.(There’s even a variable in the ctf game code that specifies how many flags can be carried at once.)\n\nI’m not going to say that this is the best map ever made, though if you think that it is, that’s good I guess. I don’t personally think that I used the gor texture set to its best extent. This map isn’t as nice looking as Hallo, Infamy, or Abbey. However, this is a much better map for double-flag CTF than the previous map I made using this idea.\n\nAreas that are possibly unbalanced/need work:\n-The tele in the main map from near one flag to near the other. Does anyone think that this makes the rocky flag too much easier to get to than the other?\n-Weapon placement and amount. I still could use some work on balance. Should there be more pickups? The other complaint about my pickup placement in the past has been that you have to go out of the way for pickups. Some of the pickups in this map are right in the middle of the path. Others are not still. Please keep in mind that I intend for players to stock up somewhat in their bases also. However, there is also the issue of weapons for Hold mode, because this map also has capture bases.\n-Narrow low passageways. This was the biggest complaint about my past maps, and hopefully no one has problems with that in this map. I have tried to make the doorways wide and tall, so hopefully there isn’t much on those lines to complain about on this map.\n\nI added capture bases because there was no real reason not to with such a large map.\n\nhttp://www.quadropolis.us/node/3688 - Previous node in which I posted the first map made around this idea, in case anyone cares to look at/read it.\nLooking back at that node reminded me that RaZgRiZ said that he’d had the same idea before, and that he also suggested a cross format. Thank you for sparking the idea for this map’s design! (actually, others said that the idea had been bouncing around in a small group for a while, well thank you everyone who may have influenced this map)\n\nThank you in advance for checking out this map! I hope for some interesting feedback about this map or this application of the dual-CTF idea.\n\n[Edit] Wow, i edited this twice within minutes of posting! I originally forgot to specify map size and license, and this second time fixes a couple grammatical errors, though I probably still missed some.\n\nMap file DuoCross.zip (3.53 MB)\nRating\n55\npoints\n (8 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Starring content will put them on front top page).\n\nAs certain discussions in the past (for example, this certain node) led to this conclusion:\nA good map is a balanced map and a balanced map can be an included or starred map\nAs moderators or administrators have no (or should not) control about which map should actually be included within Sauerbraten, I won't spend time on whenever a map should be included or not. That's up to our developers to judge. Yet we can control whether a map should be starred or not. That's why I advice to rather star a map which is balanced than having only certain specific points done well.\n\nCertain tips before starring\n\nBefore starring maps, be sure a certain amount of people already have voted but also putted constructive comments on it. So not just comments which contain The map just looks good [period], as that's the worse comment you can receive. Why? Because it's an opinion of someone which isn't based on anything.\nAlso recommending it to be starred it better as starring it right away. Even a discussion on an IRC channel could be very useful.\n\nSidenotes\n\nIf you still have no idea about the standards of inclusion, here it is.\n\nIf you still have trouble understanding the task of being a moderator, this may be useful.",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nHello people.\n\nAs most of you know I ditched SauerEnhanced before even releasing the Justice Edition port.\nThe repository has been up all the time so far, there were still some people actually messing with it apparantely.\nThe reason the project has been dropped is due to many technical problems that came because of poorly written and ported code.\nEverything was done \"just to get it working\" for Justice Edition, but in the end there were still some odd behaviors I simply didn't feel like fixing.\nI rather wanted to rewrite everything from scratch.\n\nSo, here we are: that's what UPP is going to be, SauerEnhanced done the correct way, rewritten from scratch, less mess in the code and packaging, easier to install on other platforms than Windows and mostly: without most of all the shit SauerEnhanced had. It will also try to keep the theme of Sauerbraten as well. Pure polishment. So, for that I'll skip some of the features SauerEnhanced had like stats or profiles (who wants those anyway?).\nOh well, I might keep the stats, who knows.\n\nSo, in regards to that, I need some kind of a list of features I should implement.\nAnd no, it's not some empty talk, I've already done some more work on the project, it's in early stage but hey, it's actually going somewhere!\nAnd this is where I need your help. Features. What do you want? What do you need? What would you want to see polished, tweaked, added?\nAs long as it doesn't involve any gameplay changes I will consider including it and will eventually speed the development of the mod itself up, because you actually need an idea of what you want to do. I will accept editmode ideas as well.\n\nSo, people, tell me!\nThanks and stay tuned for news\n\nUpdate (2013-10-04):\nI had an HDD crash a few weeks ago. I backed up the most important stuff I could, soon after that the drive has completely died.\nNow when I actually thought about actually finishing stuff up and releasing something, I remembered.\nI remembered I didn't back the project up.\nThat's a hell of an unfortunate way to end this project...\n\nTL;DR version:\nHDD crash, disaster, forgot to back up, project says \"bye bye\"\n\n----\n\nThread locked\n\n‹ Just a small idea Monthly Discussion August 2013: What options would you prefer into your account? ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)",

It may seem complicated the first few minutes you play it, but I hope it runs smoothly and is easy to learn to play. I hope everyone enjoys the map, PLEASE inform me of any BUGS that you guys find.

    "image": null,
    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Beta | Other | Various Licenses\nBlurb Use playername tab-completion for commands that use a client-number.\nDetailed description\n\nDescription:\n\nThis is a script i wrote that lets you use tab-completion using playernames for any command that takes a client-number.\nBasically, you create a wrapper-command that calls the real command. On this wrapper you can use tab-completion.\nThe completion lists the names of connected players as follows:\n\n        playername~<cn>\n\n\nThe wrapper then cuts everything including the last ~ from the first argument and uses the remainder as the argument for the real command.\nYou can add additional arguments after that. They are passed directly to the real command.\n\nHow to install:\n\n1. Put playernamecomplete.cfg into your sauerbraten directory and add\n\n        exec \"playernamecomplete.cfg\"\n\n\nto your autoexec.cfg\n\n2. Create a command in your autoexec.cfg that updates the completion lists. See \"Usage\" below on how the command works.\nExample:\n\n        updatecompletion = [\n            // use /f for /follow, completes non-spectators, and excludes the\n            // currently followed one\n            playernamecomplete f    follow   \"SF\"\n\n            // use /ig for /ignore, completes non-ignored players, excludes\n            // the player himself\n            playernamecomplete ig   ignore   \"PI\"\n\n            // use /unig for /unignore, completes ignored players\n            playernamecomplete unig unignore \"i\"\n\n            // use /ki for /kick, completes players with lower privilege,\n            // excludes player himself, but it's not really needed.\n            playernamecomplete ki   kick     \"Pl\"\n        ]\n\n\n3. Add binds that call this function before you enter the prompt.\nI am using CARET (^):\n\n        bind     CARET [ updatecompletion; saycommand / ]\n        specbind CARET [ updatecompletion; saycommand / ]\n        editbind CARET [ updatecompletion; saycommand / ]\n\n\nUsage:\n\n    /playernamecomplete <ALIAS> <COMMAND> [<FLAGS>] [<ARGNUM>]\n\n\nCreate a command called <ALIAS> which calls <COMMAND> supporting tab-completion of connected players.\n\n<FLAGS> specify which players appear in the list. Every character is a condition that is checked when the list is created. When all are true, the player is included.\nExample:\n\n    \"SF\" - S: excludes spectators\n           F: excludes the currently spectated player\n\n\nA List of all flags can be found below.\n\n<ARGNUM> tells the wrapper as which argument the client number should be passed to. If this is not specified, it is passed as the first argument.\n\nExample:\nUsing the following to create command \"c\"\n\n    playernamecomplete c command \"SP\" 2\n\n\nthen\n\n    /c anything~42 a b c\n\n\nwould call\n\n    /command a 42 b c\n\n\nIf you pass less than <ARGNUM> arguments to the wrapper, empty arguments (like \"\") are inserted before the cn.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe player names are transformed to lower case, which makes typing easier. After that, they are cleaned from invalid or hard to type characters using a whitelist.\n\nCompletion also works when the player name contains the delimiter, since the last occurrence of the delimiter is used.\nYou can also just type the cn without a name, since nothing is cut when there is no delimiter.\n\nYou can change the character whitelist by editing _pnc_allowedchars at the top of the script. There are also two variables which can be advanced to translate special characters to easy-to-type ones.\n\nList of flags:\n\n    s/S  -  spectator/not spectator\n    b/B  -  bot/not bot\n    i/I  -  ignored/not ignored\n    e/E  -  enemy/not enemy\n    p/P  -  current player/not current player\n    f/F  -  followed player/not followed player\n    m/M  -  master or admin/not master and not admin\n    a/A  -  admin/not admin\n    l/L  -  lower privilege/equal or higher privilege than player\n    h/H  -  higher privilege/equal or lower privilege than player\n\n\nUpdate 1: Changed some of the @'s and uses more concat(word). Also, new loopchar.\nUpdate 2: Use TABs for indenting and changed the wrappers so they don't take as much space in config.cfg.\n\nPreview\n// what i'm using in my autoexec.cfg\n\nupdatecompletion = [\n    playernamecomplete f          _my_follow       \"PSF\"\n    playernamecomplete ig         ignore           \"PI\"\n    playernamecomplete unig       unignore         \"i\"\n    playernamecomplete ki         kick             \"Pl\"\n    playernamecomplete myteam     _my_myteam       \"e\"\n    playernamecomplete otherteam  _my_otherteam    \"E\"\n    playernamecomplete switchteam _my_switchteam   \"S\"\n    playernamecomplete goteam     _my_goteam       \"PS\"\n    playernamecomplete voteki     _my_votekick     \"PM\"\n    playernamecomplete s          _my_stats        \"B\"\n    playernamecomplete st         _my_statstotal   \"B\"\n]\n\nbind     CARET [ updatecompletion; saycommand / ]\nspecbind CARET [ updatecompletion; saycommand / ]\neditbind CARET [ updatecompletion; saycommand / ]\n\n_my_follow = [\n    if (!

You'd think that after having the problem once, I would have expected it again, but NOPE. Well, hopefully it won't happen again in the future.\n\nMap file Gulley(fixed).zip (1.65 MB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Release | Alpha | Standalone | All Platforms | GNU GPL v2\nBlurb A mod which changes Sauerbraten's appearance to that of Open Arena.\nScreenshot \nGet original file (490KB)\nDetailed description\n\nInformation\nAfter a quite long period of time, I would like to present; Open Arena Appearance Mod!\nThis project has different intentions. I've been trying to get content of Open Arena actually \"work\" within Sauerbraten (which often is a pain as everything has to be adjusted to make it work, excluding the part to make it look good).\nThere hasn't been changed anything to the code of Sauerbraten as I'm not planning to change that (if you really want to feel Open Arena, you should play it after all).\nThe mod consists mainly out models (meshes, skins, sounds, icons, muzzleflashes), which I probably will expand to fonts, icons and particles also.\nAt last, be sure to check out Open Arena's website!\n\nP.S.\nIf you want to look from a screenshot with a better resolution, this might do.\n\nInstalling\nAs you may have noticed due the file-size, the original Sauerbraten isn't included within the content, for several reasons;\n- It can be used on all platforms in this state.\n- The mod can be installed on elder releases also.\n- I'm pretty sure it saves you a lot of time if you just download the newest setup of Sauerbraten, install it and then extract everything from this content into that directory. You could also extract it into the C:\\Users\\Documents\\My Games\\Sauerbraten folder (this is safer, but mrfixit will still appear instead of the intended playermodel)\n\nSub-mods\nThere are several skins which aren't being used at default (like for the angelyss and assassin model, but for skelebot as well) which can be specified manually (just modify the md3.cfg within the same folder and change md3skin l_hair skin_blue.png skin_blue.png to md3skin l_hair blue_neko1.png blue_neko1.png for example).\nThere are also additional sounds to each model while the default Open Arena sounds are just default. Just rename sounds.cfg to something else (like sounds_default.cfg) and rename the one which you would like to hear ingame (like from sounds_angelyss.cfg to sounds.cfg).\n\nKnown Bugs\n- The assassin playermodel won't get loaded in it's current state as the ogro folder is hardcoded. So if you want to use it, switch it with another playermodel (but look out for the powerup-directory; they may differ).\n- The vweps somehow pitch with the position of the camera while the model stops pitching.\n\nTo-Do-List\n- Replace certain skins, icons and/or textures\n- Make playermodels appear brighter ingame\n- Get mrfixit and ogro not being loaded but the intentioned ones instead\n- Make the fonts work\n- Change the layout of the hud to something more similar to Open Arena\n- Import the menu inclusive sounds (unlikely, but let's try anyway)\n- Reanimate certain models (as Open Arena uses a different animation system to make a model go left or right - just rotate the lower mesh about 30 degrees)\n- Pick variation between sounds ingame or via a certain command.\n- Bugfixing?

I took the layout from an old artistic design I made several years ago (called keys).\nThe actual experiment was to check how geometry from Cube Engine 2 itself reacts when it has been exported to .obj-format first, renamed all groups (as finding out which slot is what is more a pain whenever you want to do more than just this) and exporting it back to the game engine again (despite converting to the lighter but less accurate for static geometry; .md3-format).\nThis content isn't meant to earn any points; I don't care about your rating here (why else would it be conceptual =P?). But I do care if you find anything odd or if you have something which could be improved specific to the exported and reimported model.\n\nImprovements\n1st of April 2013\n- Added spinsky to the map and mdlspin to the model for an optical illusion.\n- Changed the model's config-file to use bumpmapping also (oddly enough, it didn't work the first time).\n\nSidenotes\nPlease be aware of when unzipping, put the mapmodel directly into the Sauerbraten directory! (so paste mapmodels\\suicizer\\miniature into Sauerbraten\\packages/models\\mapmodels, not into C:\\User/Documents\\Mygames\\Sauerbraten!). The reason for this is that you don't have to unzip the entire lunaran-texturepack in the C:\\User/Documents\\Mygames\\Sauerbraten directory, which saves up a lot of file-size and keeps things clean.\n\nMap file miniature_1apr13.zip (137.93 KB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

Anyway, I'm surprised by Quad's sudden shutdown/move/rebirth at a new location. As far as I can tell, Quadropolis is working again, (Obviously, I have been able to log in)but it is entirely possible that this forum post will not actually post or whatever.\n\nDoes anyone know who hosts 4-cube because Quad apparently had problems with GoDaddy, but as far as I know that was with some specific aspect of the site rather than GoDaddy. All my information at this point is just coming from the post on 4-Cube about the move.\n\nWell, this is a forum topic now, so if anyone knows anything more about this than me, I guess I'll defer to what you have to say. To me, just a general Quad user, this development was sudden and completely unexpected.\n\nEDIT:\nI probably should have looked at the Cube Engine Forums first also, as there is already a discussion ongoing there.\n\n‹ Cant find new content CTF map idea: vertical gameplay ›\n\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\nAs most of you all witnessed Quadropolis has moved to a new server. This should mean nothing else as we, the moderators and administrators of it want to preserve as much as possible. Despite that, this is the perfect time for some input from the community which uses the website to view and comment on nodes to give some input about how to actually improve the experience of Quadropolis.\n\nThe reason of this content is to stop posts on the official website of Sauerbraten, as that isn't the only game engine neither the only game which uses this website.\n\n\n\nNotifications\n\n\nIt is uncertain that anything can actually be improved. But to start this as certain orientation about what other people than administrators or moderators think shouldn't be considered as a bad idea.\nAny input (even and actually especially those which you agree!) will be saved on this node to keep a certain poll of what people actually like to see and what not.\nI'll put your name after the title of the idea whenever you agree those certain points.\nEverything will be considered as a honest and polite comment, as long as it's constructive and has no selfish means.\n\n\n\nThe Ideas\n\n\nWell, it's has become a quite big number. Maybe one day I'll sort them out and merge certain requests together. But for now, just keep reading!\n\n\n\nLayout\n\n\nOld domain name (Skur, Zamwa, SkiingPenguins, Suicizer)\n\"Since it's got nothing to do with this 4-cube page excecpt the host I think it should have it's old domain back.\"\n\nNew Look (SkiingPenguins, Suicizer, zombie-apocalypse)\n\"The new site needs to have a refreshed look, and i do not think we should keep the content from the old site. i think the old site's data should be kept somewhere, but not in a way that is indistinguishable from the new site.\"\n\nModerator/Admin Forum (Suicizer)\nThere isn't such a thing as a forum for moderators (neither for admins) to discuss about certain things on Quadropolis. I once bowed down about this but had not enough privileges to do the job.\n\nPrivate messaging system (Mmeaninglez, SkiingPenguins)\nAdd a messaging system where users could talk to each other in private.\n\nFix up the pinned-weight order (Razgriz, Suicizer, Skur)\nAll lists around Quadropolis carry a pinned-weight order (like the frontpage, but even just nodes itself also as the node itself always appears above comments). But there are certain fix-ups to be done.\n\nMaking important nodes easier to find (Skur, Suicizer, zombie-apocalypse)\nCertain nodes (like the 10 commandments, packaging guide, etc) still seem hard to reach for newcomers. What about putting those under a page which is for guides only? There currently seems to be a header already, but when clicking on, uncategorised nodes seem to appear.\n\nCleaning up the header bar (Suicizer)\nThe header bar currently consists out of Forums, New Content, New MODs, New Scripts, Best Content, Best MODs, Best Scripts, Guides, News Archive, Create Content, Login/Register. This seems to be pretty odd, as everything with the header New ... would already appear in the Recent Content column, while the headers Best ... are often pretty subjective. It doesn't makes it very organized also.\nSo what about cleaning up that bar and doing the very same with Best ... and New ... as what has been done with the header of Forums, if you jump to that page, different items will be shown all related to the forum.\n\nSupport social media (VampireFrog, Suicizer)\nQuadroplis has no link towards any social media centre so far (not even IRC). Maybe it gets time for such option?\n\nMore icons around Quadropolis (VampireFrog, Suicizer)\nA lot of things on Quadropolis are textual displayed. Some more icons next words could change the look of Quadropolis already.\n\n\n\nContent-based input\n\nStop supporting old content (SkiingPenguins, Suicizer)\nThe old nodes still should be accessible to everyone, but shouldn't be on this server anymore. We don't want to keep Quadropolis like it actually was, are we?\n\nModeration tags (Razgriz, Suicizer)\nBring back the moderation tag-system as we once had, but then expressed shorter or by using icons.\n\nImproved way for notifications (Razgriz, Suicizer, kz1)\nChange the notification-tag system to something with icons instead of words like \"singleplayer\", \"Win32\", etc.\n\nSeparate page for bug-tracking (Razgriz)\nAdd a separate page to put comments on which is meant specific for mistakes/lackings within a map.\n\nClean up content creation page (Suicizer)\nWhenever creating a new node (like content), things which are optional (the notification tags like the size of the map, which mode, etc) put them on another page or \"hide\" them until you click on a certain link within the create content-page to make them appear (pretty much like when you already have seen a certain comment and want to read it another time).\n\nMore dynamic screenshot resolution (Suicizer, SkiinPenguins)\nSo far the limit is up to 640x480 pixels whenever uploading a screenshot to a node. Maybe it would be nice if you are also able to upload something like 512x512.\n\nReward good content better (Suicizer)\nIn the past, after a certain number of good nodes (as in containing valuable information or an impressive map/mod/script), people often gained a rank. This has stopped about 3 years ago.\n\n\n\nVoting System\n\nOld voting system (SkiingPenguins, Suicizer, Justin, Mmeaninglez)\nLet's go back to our old voting system with just an average of all votes.\n\nReduce the vote-scale (Zamwa, Skur, SkiingPenguins, Suicizer)\nJust reduce the scale of voting from 9 options (1 to 10) to only 3 options (-1, 0 and +1). Our beloved Sauerbraten developer once had the theory the less options someone has to choose from, the less more chance the user does the right thing.\n\nImplement starred content in voting-system (Zamwa, SkiingPenguins, Suicizer, Skur)\n\"Remove the \"starred content\" from a moderators control to an automated system based on votes over 5 and above 75% approval!\"\n\nRemove banned accounts from votings (Razgriz, Suicizer)\nLet administrators and moderators be able to delete votes which are made by \"anonymous\" accounts (most of them banned whenever so). Automating this process would be even better.\n\n\n\nSearch Tools\n\nProper in-website searching (Razgriz, Suicizer)\n\"Using google to do the searches in quadro isn't exactly the most convenient method, given how it occasionally breaks down on itself regardless of browser used.\"\n\nReally unpublish content (Suicizer)\nAny user is able to see unpublished contents in the search list, yet aren't authorized to access it. What about just completly censorize it? It adds question-marks for certain people on things which they shouldn't be able to see anyway.\n\nSearch by author (Somedude, Mmeaninglez, Suicizer)\nAdd a search option so you can search certain content by author also (without needing to track his history of commenting and posting).\n\n\n\nEvent-based input\n\nMonthly Polls (Suicizer)\nResurrect the Montly Polls from their grave.\n\nMore events (Suicizer)\nOrganize more events than just a website which you can post your stuff on and let it get reviewed.\n\n\n\nUser/moderator/administrator-related input\n\nAdvanced profile settings (Suicizer, SkiingPenguins, Skur, zombie-apocalypse )\nSome more profile settings for normal users than just their full name, bio and website (like a profile image of 64x64?).\n\nChangelog of content for users (Suicizer, Vampirefrog)\nSo far you need to post a comment on your own node to get some attention again if you've updated your map. This actually isn't the meaning of commenting. When users are able to see through the log that a content has been updated, they probably will check it out once more way easier.\nAnother plan to tackle this problem is to add a tag in recent content which says Updated!, instead of New!.\n\nA new team (Suicizer, SkiingPenguins)\nSomehow we actually only have 1 moderator which is truly active, which is suprisingly me :(. I think a small clean up in this section could help and start with fresh team of new moderators and some small amount of new administrators.\nThis is not the right thread to ask if you can be moderator, neither admin. Our team will contact you instead.\n\nSynchronize the ranking system (Suicizer)\nAt the moment, you are able to be a warned user, yet have fully admin rights. This is a quite odd appearance and no-one except the person which grants the privileges knows about what certain people can do and what they can't do. Maybe we need more ranks, like silver stars for moderators or super users, for example.\n\n‹ hello (about objexporter) Mapping Guides ›\n\nRating\n10\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

In case that selection was not enough for you to enjoy, there's also the Bananabread java(script) port for browser based gaming with WebGL and Firefox.\n\nThe deal is you can come to Quadropolis aka. Quad and download/discuss the latest community contributed content updates, model and texture packages, sky boxes, mods, patches and scripts.\n\nAll the content published at Quad is rated and updated on a regular basis. While cube2 is completely free in all aspects so you can use it for both commercial and non commercial projects the content may not have the same flexibility. Make sure you check the content license and build version before downloading to minimise wasted time/bandwidth or legal concerns for professional usage.\n\nIf you are a Red Eclipse player then your life is made easier with in-game updates available and maintained by the \"RE\" dev team for your convenience. For the other builds/ports/forks you can keep up to date by coming back here on a regular basis to get your fix. Yes, everyone is well aware of the options for in-game updates. It is a topic that has been widely discussed. There are various reasons for and against in-game updates. Depending on your game server you can run map updates with setmap/getmap. Not everyone has high speed connections to keep up with large package updates and some server hosts prefer to keep the focus on gameplay rather than map building and modding.\n\nIf you are serious about mapping, modding and mayhem then you can find plenty of other people to collaborate with here. Keep in mind that most of the globally distributed content will end up here at some point. Quad seeks to be agnostic about the actual game engine and game play. It's a community effort where everyone is welcome to get involved. The main focus is on quality. So if you want to find the bugs in your work this is the place to get that feedback.",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Final Release | Source mod | Content | Linux | Windows | Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND)\nBlurb Small content and source mod for Sauerbraten and eventually Assault Cube\nScreenshot \nGet original file (104KB)\nDetailed description\n\nThis project is no longer being maintained\n\nGraphOX was a small source and content mod designed for any user to install simply and easily.\n\nWhat was it?\nGraphOX means Graphic of X, and originally was to be a graphical mod for Assault Cube and Sauerbraten before I thought, nah, I'm lazy, rather do something small to waste some time. As time went on, it became bigger and better, and gained a few users who are loyal to us. We have grown feature-wise as well.\n\nWhat does it do?\nIt was just a really tiny content and source mod, that allows some small changes to the core. Has a bit of added functionality, and stuffs.\n\nWhere can I download it?\nThe current release for GraphOX is here with a news post here (v2.0-b2).\n\nOmgomgomg I downloaded it, how to install it?\nWindows users, copy bin/sauerbraten-grpx.exe to either of:\n- \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Sauerbraten\\bin\\\" and \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Sauerbraten\\bin64\"\nor\n- \"C:\\Program Files\\Sauerbraten\\bin\\\" and \"C:\\Program Files\\Sauerbraten\\bin64\"\nand copy the rest to \"C:\\Users\\\\Documents\\My Games\\Sauerbraten\"\n\nLinux users, I assume you're clever, but I'm not sure.\nCopy everything to your sauerbraten folder.\n\nWhat else comes with this?\nit provides a little better FPS due to a different customized build system, has scope zooming, auto-messages, and more.\n\nDoes this mod mess up my Sauerbraten config?\nNope, it writes to a file called \"graphox.cfg\" and stores all the variables there.\n\nI want to post a bug/complain about something\nSure, register at http://graphox.us/ and post in the forums, or go to #graphox.us on irc.gamesurge.net\n\nI want to contribute to GraphOX\nWell, beta testers are always needed, but as a one-man-band, I need developers helping ^^ if you know any C++, contact me @ #graphox.us on GameSurge\n\nI want to sourcemod this\nDownload the community source once completed (community source removes build system, changes a lot of things)\n\nAre you on any sort of social network?\nYes, we are on facebook @ http://facebook.com/graphox\n\nWhat are the current features of v2.0-b2?\nWell, there is a small list, namely\n- integrated, in-game IRC\n- full-screen zooming crosshair\n- auto-messages\n- crosshair bumping\n- SauerEnhanced HUD\n- automatic weapon change on ammo pickup\n- themes (soon able to create own themes)\n- extended scoreboard\n\nEverything works as expected (from our side)\n\nAre there any bugs, or glitches, or stuffs?\nActually, the only bug I could find was with the IRC client, but that's from the default Sauerbraten editor.\n\nIs there anything you *disabled*?\nI disabled the \"rate\" command to stop the old lag \"hack\" from exploiting it, and that's about it.\n\nWhat upcoming features will we expect?\nThe only one I can say, is joystick (console control (ps3, xbox), flight thingy, etc) capabilities.\n\nUPDATES - UPDATES - UPDATES - UPDATES\nv2.0 beta 2 (22/10/2013):\n- added new features to list\n- updated download link\n- addded link to news post\n\nRating\n19\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Have you got the spirit of a hardcore mapper and know what it takes to make a singleplayer map?\nThen sign up for the challenge and start mapping on the 10th of June at 0:00 GMT!\n\nSigning up\n\nTo participate, copy and paste this template into a comment:\n\nName of participant(s)*: Blah\nMapping Ability*: Newcomer/Experienced/Expert\nTheme(s): What ever you feel like\nSize: 12 or smaller\nPreview storyline:* In a far far universe, but not that far from ours...\n\n*This field is required for signing up and can't be \"blank\".\n\nSome thing you should know about signing up:\n\nYou are allowed to sign up till the 9th of June 0:00 GMT. Any entries which sign in after that date are still allowed to do so until the 1st of July.\nThe challenge starts on the 10th of June at 0:00 GMT and ends on the 1st 29th of September 0:00 GMT.\nYou can sign up as a team with a maximum of 2 persons in a team.\nThe field Mapping Ability can change during the challenge or in the end for anyone which signs up. The reason it actually exist is to give newcomers a chance also, instead of always the same persons which are taking the lead.\nYet another point about the Mapping Ability; If you just joined the Quadropolis community, consider yourself as a newcomer. If you know Quadropolis quiet well and even have a map within the release of Sauerbraten, consider yourself as expert. If both of them don't apply; consider yourself as experienced.\nThe preview storyline only has to be about 3 sentences and should not reveal the end of the story (of course).\nParticipating\n\nIf you have signed up, then the next step arrived; participation. As you need a node to work on, please use this template for your map's title (this is to recognize it is participating for the challenge):\nTitle: SPMC: name_of_map\nBlurb: A participation of the Single Player Mapping Challenge\nGame: Sauerbraten\nGame Mode(s): Singleplayer\nLicense: Anything else except other license or various licenses (unless you actually have added so)\n\nInformation\n\nEverything which can be considered as guide-lines while participating is provided beneath this header.\n\nOnly 2 participants per team are allowed and should participate only once.\nThe map should have a storyline which makes you start at a specific area and end at another.\nThe map shouldn't be bigger as mapsize 12.\nThere shouldn't be more than 250 monsters around.\nThe node should contain a full story line (this rather is a rule also).\nEverything should be presented on just 1 map.\nThe map shouldn't contain more as 150k of wtr and shouldn't be bigger as 8 Megabyte in file-size (the .ogz-file).\nOnly the votes of other participants count on your node, as only participants know the whole story.\nThe winner(s) of the challenge earns to have their node starred on Quadropolis and maybe even something else also!\nYou are allowed to make preparations for mapping already (like picking textureset, setting up a config-file with scripts, etc), but you are not allowed to map until it is the 10th of June. This actually can't be controlled, so let's relay on trust, shall we?\nYou are allowed to attach any other content to your node, as long as it's not in the same zip-file as your participation map and is relevant to the node. You still should notify so when attaching anything to your node of participation.\nRules\n\nAs every mapping challenge requires some reminders and boundaries, the next rules are legit for this challenge.\n\nGeneral Rules\nDo not plagiarize. All work submitted must be your own.\nDo not create inappropriate content within your submission.\nDo not edit another entrant's submission, or have anybody else edit you own entry. The only person who can edit your map is you, or a team member if you are on a team.\nCopying content from existing maps is not permitted or tolerated, unless it's configuration-based content (as texture settings, scripts, etc).\nOnly participate for 1 challenge at the time, unless it's a personal challenge (which you should announce at signing up).\nCustom textures and models are allowed, as long as the license is permitting so.\nIf custom textures or models are used that are not made by you, the entrant, a text file containing the proper licensing is required indicating permission of use (This is a non profit organization, everything is free to distribute, blah blah blah).\nIf a person has entered Solo, another person MAY join that person to form a team of two. Their entry post must be modified to suit (both their names and a team name if applicable).\nSome think that credit for the map may be given to the other team-mate where it is not due, but keep in mind that it is the First member who allowed the other to join him or her.\nUse your common sense. If there is something you are absolutely unsure about, or things that you don't think are allowed but not stated, then ask here.\nContent-based Rules\nMake your very own node to participate before the 1st of July.\nThe map should be packaged with the guidelines of the Packaging Guide.\nThe story-line should be provided on your node, not within the map.\nThe map should have a flowing layout (as in bumping against walls and ceilings frequently is not allowed), without a lot of interruptions of the story line.\nYou should show any progress (by posting another screenshot, changelog and update of your map) at the end of each week (which is on 17th and 24th of June, the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22th and the 29th of July, etc).\nThe map should be in it's Stable release status at end of the challenge (so nearly finished).\nThe content on the node should contain at least:\n.ogz-file (the actual map)\n.jpg-file (a screenshot)\n.cfg-file (a configuration-file for all scripts and triggers)\nVoting Period\n\nAfter the 1st of October there will be 2 weeks of voting which map will be actually the best. This means:\nPost your map on 30th of September or the 1st of October!\n\nThere are several requirements for participating the voting period:\n\nYou should have signed up for participation of this event.\nYou should have an own node which displays your participation.\nYou and your cooperative team-mate are both agreeing with the same rate which you give to a certain node (only 1 vote counts per team).\n\nThere are several requirements for the actual voting:\n\nEach node is being rated individually (not just 1 which is best and the rest of the participations don't matter).\nEach node receives a different rating than other nodes which you've rated (you can't rate 2 nodes with the same number, like giving them both an 8 for example).\nIf you've been disqualified during the challenge, your vote isn't legit as well.\nIf you won't vote, then your node isn't in for participation either which means you will be disqualified.\n\nAfter the 13th of October, the results will be published on an individual page which displays the top 3 nodes with of course, a special place for the winner.\n\nDuring Voting Period\n\nWhen the challenge has ended and you've uploaded your map on your node you are free to do the next couple of things (which are related to this challenge):\n\nVote on other participating nodes (duh).\nProvide feedback on other participating nodes.\nImprove your map from feedback of other mappers which comment on your node.\n\nKeep in mind that editing during this period shouldn't be seen as extra time to finish up your map as people should be able to download and rate your map at the very first week of the voting period.\n\nResources\n\nAs Singleplayer requires a lot of scripting and most mappers aren't quite good at this, I'll just include some links on this node.\n\nGithub CubeScript Tutorial\nRknigh21 Cubescript Tutorial\nSandbox Tutorial List\nCube Wiki Scripting Guide\nSingle Player Level Design Tutorial\nSingle Player Mapping Tips\nOther\n\nQuestions and discussion on this thread are not preferred. You rather take contact by mail (quadropolis@gmail.com) or use IRC instead (I'm often on irc.quakenet.org #sauerbraten).\n\n\n\nI wish you good luck and some fine mapping!\n\nlogin to post comments",

However, there are some rules:\n\nYou can only use the type of ammunition which is spawning inside the room.\nYou can only use 1 shot of ammunition at each obstacle (with exception of the bullets).\nWhen you fall into the water, you're considered to be \"dead\" and spawning again (you aren't really dead as that would take a lot of time before you would be back to your original obstacle again).\nNo cooperation of other players is allowed, every obstacle can be conquered on your very own skill.\nBeing in coop-edit mode isn't allowed at all.\n\nThe exceptions on that:\n\nYou can use 2 types of ammunition (but only 1 of each!) when there is more than 1 type spawning inside the room.\nYou may use more than 1 shot of each type of ammunition in the room which you may only complete by using grenades while moving upwards and the room which you may only complete by using rockets while moving up- or downwards.\n\nOf course you can just ignore these rules when you just want to practice for fun.\n\nTips\nThe old ironsnout model always shows off what to do. In the entrance room it shows off which weapon should be taken for the room behind it, while inside rooms ironsnout shows off how to actually use that weapon.\nIf you've never trickjumped before (or want to learn on a tutorialish way), you rather put the map in Single Player mode. The reason for this is that several triggers and scripts could help you what to do next (for example; taking the right weapon automatically, setting a timer so you can see how fast you are, etc).\nI would recommend playing the map in Single Player mode also for people which like fancy sounds and celebrations after being on the other side of a room.\nYou can't record demo's in the SinglePlayer mode, neither ammunition will spawn back, so for real practice and show off, it's best to stick in Free For All.\nNotifications\n\nThe map is currently designed for Justice edition (as the grenade-launcher is just way better to trickjump on that version). I'll maybe update it to Collect edition but for now, it works fine.\nIf you find any solution to a certain obstacle which you think is original, just put a demo-file in a comment.\nThere are several demo's added from certain rooms. You can watch them by putting demo \"scetj1_[room]_[date]\" into your console line.\n\nCredits\n\nI would like to thank Yves Allaire for his DSI-texturepack, John Siar for the old Ironsnout and weapons, makkE for the projectiles and Skur for his wonderful yet simple timer-script.\nAbout the license of the map:\n\nYou are free to use any of the obstacles within your own map, as long as you wouldn't copy complete halls.\nYou are not free to modify anything on the map. Everything is intended to be like that. If you still think certain things which appear on the map look odd, please report by commenting.\nWhen doing anything which is allowed from this license, please still mention so if you've copied any of the obstacles within the map.\nImprovements\n\n- Add similar obstacle for grenades as the rockets (where you've got to drop a rocket then rocketjump when hitting the floor below).\n- Add even more demo's.\n\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?fgy13atx78rclji\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I have had an incredible amount of work over the last couple weeks.\n\nMy map needs about an hour of work to be technically playable, so I will get that posted soon.\n\nDuring the last month, I have though of several better ideas than this for a singleplayer map. I might make them eventually, but I don't really want to do more with this map. To be happy with it, I would need to remake most of it, as a lot of sections don't play nearly as well as I'd hoped.\n\nAlso, this map will likely not have lighting at all, because that would take a long time, which I don't have.\nPosted now is the nearly complete map, but it lacks triggers and stuff for roughly the last quarter of the map.\nAlso, I never remade the balloon to look better :( Oh yeah, and the platforms/elevators needed to navigate one part don't work either. Like I said, this isn't finished, and I hope others maps are better.\n\n-----\n7/29/13\ni have been doing more work on this map, I am going on vacation for another week. meaningful update when I get back.\n-------\n7/10/2013\nI did some more work yesterday. There are now a few actual monsters and switches in the map, but I haven't changed the .cfg at all sice I last updated it, so I should really work on that.\nAnyway, yeah, I should work more on this map instead of other various things I've worked on.\n-----\n7/1/2013\nI have done less than 2 hours of work on my singleplayer map in the past week. I put far more effort toward a ctf map I'm calling HyPass, which has absolutely nothing in common with this map. Yay.\nIf I do work soon I may make a midweek update here, but basically I have nothing to show for now.\n-------\n6/23/13\nPosted my work so far in a cfg and ogz file, and two scans of sketches i made during the first week of the contest, while I was on vacation. I've gotten more done than I though I would.\nI still need to make a better-looking balloon(s) for the map than the one I have currently.\nI am calling the map \"air\" for now. The map files are the correct ones.\nAlternate link for when Quadropolis no longer has this update: (In case anyone cares later)\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/f0pq8ssfst9aawr/mmesp_checkpoint_2.zip\n-------\n6/8/13\nNOTHING HERE WILL BE USED IN THE ACTUAL MAP. THIS IS NOT STARTING EARLY.\nHowever, the contest guidelines say to start a node beforehand, so this is it. I will be on vacation next week and miss the start of the contest, so I probably wont have an update by the first checkpoint. Anyway, as you can probably tell by the title, the map will still be a sky castle, and feature you shooting things.\nAll that is currently here is stuff I made to make sure I remember how doors and triggers and monsters and gameclip work. The carrot to end the level does not work, so if you wanted to play the shortest single-player level ever, too bad, you can't finish it.\nThe balloon is a beta design for a fancier balloon I may use in the final.\nAnyway, I clearly have nothing interesting to contribute at this point, so yeah, see you all in a week or so.\n\nMap file Mmean 'nearly' finished.zip (292.08 KB)\nRating\n21\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This champion brings strange and amazing weapons, which is fortunate, as the dungeons below Tristram are now filled with new and deadlier monsters with similar firepower.\n\nWeek 1 (-June 17):\n\nThis week I blocked in the layout for the village. I spent most of my time refreshing my cubescript skills (or lack thereof).\nMy goal for the next week is to flesh out the village a little more and start blocking out the design of the cathedral level(s).\n\nWeek 2 (-June 24):\n\nI spent more time on the village and started mapping out the cathedral level. Plodding along as planned. Next week, I intend to work out the main layout of the cathedral level(s) and perhaps start scripting a little bit.\n\nWeek 3 (-July 1):\n\nNot much accomplished. Expanded the dungeon a bit and refined the village some more. I'm starting to get worried about the WTR limit. I've decided to go for broke, and if I have to, I'll decimate what I can for the map entry. If it comes to that, I can always release a second 'unlimited' version of my work.\n\nWeek 4 (-July 8):\n\nAgain, not much done. I'm going to reign in my goals for the map size and focus on completing the various elements I'd like to include in the entire campaign. My goal for next week is to flesh out the catacombs and some of the scripts for the cathedral.\n\nWeek 5 (-July 15):\n\nDid a bit of layout for the catacombs and tweaked the lighting throughout. Next week I hope to finish the catacombs and start on the caves. I still haven't fully implemented the scripting either, hopefully I can blitz that one sooner than later.\n\nWeek 6 (-July 22):\n\nUnplanned hiatus\n\nWeek 7 (-July 29):\n\nFurther work on the catacombs. Fleshed out a bit of story. Still lots to do.\n\nUnfortunately, I must withdraw from the competition. I am looking forward to checking out the other entries when time permits.\n\nRating\n9\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

I'm pretty sure the total file-size can be reduced towards 30Mb (it was a total of 85Mb before actually packaging). I'll release a better (bug-fixed?) version of the map tomorrow (just doing so just in case actually).\n1 October 2013: Re-uploaded the zip-file (with a working single player story line), all bugs should be fixed. Chopped off 9Mb of the file-size as well.\n2 - 6 October 2013: Bug fixing. The end should be more logical now (as nearly a real end). Added a (so far unlogical) secret within the map. Managed to clean up the zip-file some more, it's less than 29Mb now.\n\nURL http://www.mediafire.com/?ykv74p87537jd5l\nRating\n45\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

It contains large open outside areas mostly covered with ice and snow, but also rather narrow pathways and caves in the lower levels, which mainly consist of volcanic rock and lava. The buildings are kept in a medieval style, which also defines when the story is taking place.\nThe gameplay is oriented to classic arena shooters like quake, but also has elements from other games. Aside from shooting up monsters the map also contains some jumping puzzles, same as some intended trickjumps for speedrunners and such (If you're doing really good the script might even comment on it, hehe). You shouldn't have any problems with finding enough ammo since i placed plenty of it, because for me there is nothing worse than having to use my pistol.\n\nIf you notice any bugs, get stuck, or have any suggestions please leave a comment so I can fix/improve it. If you really want to help me with the optimization and balancing it would be awesome if you would record your really first playthrough and send it to me, since that would show me how it works for players not having played it 100 times and knowing every corner (so don't feel ashamed if u die a lot, it's my fault!).\n\nStoryline\nLast night monsters broke into your mates house and stole their gold. One of them saw them running up the hill and entering the abandoned church. None of the locals dare to go in there, but they offer you half of their gold, if you manage to get it back. You decide to take the challenge, but what you find is worse than expected...\n\nTimelapse Video\nI recorded a timelapse video in 2fps FullHD with the ingame recorder, which has later been speeded up x15 to 30fps. It covers the creation of all the geometry, texturing and lighting until version 1.0 of the map. I did not record the moster placing and scripting, as it required endless playtesting, what isn't very interesting to watch. The video is five and a half hours long and I obviously don't expect anyone to watch the whole video, but I had to uplaod it as it was there and you might find one or the other part interesting. :) Would be nice if you leave a coment on YouTube too, but that's up to you of course!\n\nChangelog\n\nWeek 1:\n- Layouted terrain\n- Layouted and detailed church\n\nWeek 2:\n- Finished church\n- Layouted some rooms below the church\n- Started to smooth out terrain\n\nWeek 3:\n- Detailed one room below the church\n- Smoothed out more terrain, mainly inside the cave\n- Made a few props to paste later on\n\nWeek 4:\n~ On holiday ~\n\nWeek 5:\n- Smoothed out more terrain inside the cave\n- Layouted and made a few mountains behind the cave\n\nWeek 6:\n- Smoothed out more snow terrain\n- Layouted and made more mountains\n\nWeek 7:\n~ On holiday ~\n\nWeek 8:\n- Made many more mountains\n- Connected mountains with each other, the cave and flat terrain parts\n- Set up the mapmodel config\n\nWeek 9:\n- Made few more mountains\n- Built a third lava fall into the cave\n- Connected many individual areas\n\nWeek 10:\n- Added a waterfall to one side of the river\n- Finished the inner part of the cave\n- Built a wooden elevator\n\nWeek 11:\n- Finished the snow terrain geometry\n- Blendbrushed the outside area\n- Lit the inner part of the cave\n- Made a house at the spawn area\n- Redid inner part of the church\n\nWeek 12:\n- Detailed and lit several rooms\n- Built doors and trapdoors into the arenas\n- Layouted the finale\n\nWeek 13:\n- Detailed and lit more rooms\n- Detailed and expanded the finale\n\nWeek 14:\n- Finished the geometry\n- Finished the lighting\n- Placed sounds\n- Placed monsters\n- Placed pick-ups\n- Added triggers\n- Did all scripting\n- Playtested\n- Fixed a LOT of bugs\n\nUpdate v1.1 (2013-10-04)\n- Trigger placement optimization\n- \"killsendsp\" is now set to 0\n- Small changes in the script\n\nUpdate v1.2 (2013-10-14)\n- Fixed dialogs\n- Fixed plenty of geometry errors\n- Fixed some clipping mistakes\n- Added a 3rd hidden HP Boost\n- Began skytexturing glitch cubes\n- Optimized item placement\n- Housedoor opens again now, if you die before the first respawnpoint.\n- Cleaned up the script a bit\n\nCredits\nSpecial thanks to Yves 'evillair' Allaire and Gregor Koch for the textures.\n\nHappy fragging!\n-Skur\n\nMap file skrsp1_v1.2.zip (8.26 MB)\nRating\n140\npoints\n (15 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Beside those outside areas there are quite narrow inside structures that are designed in a verry technical look. The level design provides arena shooter elements in combination with some puzzels.

I modified both menu design and layout, plus the game HUD. Currently, some icons are still missing, such as red, blue and green icons for all playermodels except for ironsnout, mainly because I don't need them.\n\nI also changed some color values in the source code and added a method to draw the one-line-input field you see in the screenshot. The modified files are included, so if you want to, replace the original ones (after backing them up) and recompile as usual (on linux: make && make install in /src).\n\nUpdate 1:\n\n- remade guiskin.png\n- subtle fixes like icon sizes and different shades of white\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n- minor fixes\n- added cursor\n- added Open Sans font (udpated, now better readable, just like the old font)\n\nUpdate 3:\n\n- changed icon for unknown servers in server browser\n- fixed right padding in GUI skin (for now, a real fix requires source code edits)\n- improved icons, they now fit with the font (aka they have a 3px border now and should be vertically aligned with text)\n- removed \"info\" icon from most guitexts, \"info.png\" is now a blank 64x64 to provide spacing when desired\n- restructured console tab in options\n- improved autoexec tab in options\n- improved background banner\n- more source code changes:\n- separators and sliders now get painted by OpenGL, no guislider.png required anymore (they are still included in case you don't want to recompile)\n- changed GUI text color to white\n- one-line input fields have a new look\n\nUpdate 4:\n\n- replaced HUD icons in items.png (radar blibs etc. still to come): http://imgur.com/a/VvxNV#7\n- modifications on scoreboard (requires recompile; known bug: separator before spectators sometimes flickering)\n- changes to the options menu (tabs game, gfx, console, autoexec.cfg)\n- moved server browser settings to the right\n\nUpdate 5:\n\n- server browser text is now consistent with scoreboard and the rest of the UI (entries are white, column headers grey)\n- added a simple mapshot_frame.png\n- fixed a bug in the gfx tabs of the options menu (an empty line was missing on the right if 'dynamic lights' was displayed as an option on the left)\n\nUpdate 6:\n\n- moved to http://sauerworld.org/forum/index.php?topic=3.0\n\nMod file sauer_flat.zip (659.43 KB)\nURL http://sauerworld.org/forum/index.php?topic=3.0\nRating\n40\npoints\n (4 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Alpha | Source mod | All Platforms | Public Domain\nBlurb (Partly Inspired by Brutal Doom and Touhou)\nScreenshot \nGet original file (59KB)\nDetailed description\n\nSauer has lots of great singleplayer maps, but there's really something missing from the singleplayer experience. Monsters take really long breaks in between shooting at you, and this happens even on the highest skill levels. But there's a fix to this:\n\nIn the file src/fpsgame/monster.cpp, go to line 202 and comment out this line:\n\nif((!melee || dist<20) && !rnd(longrange ? (int)dist/12+1 : min((int)dist/12+1,6)) && enemy->state==CS_ALIVE) // get ready to fire\n\nand replace it with this line:\n\nif((!melee || dist<20) && enemy->state==CS_ALIVE) // get ready to fire..\n\nThen compile and start a singleplayer match. You will find that the monsters are MUCH more challenging, and overall the singleplayer experience is much faster and more strategic. The Rhinos are a bit OP though, especially since some mappers tend to put groups of 10 rhinos in every corner, so you might also want to change line 23 from this:\n\n{ GUN_CG, 18, 70, 2, 70, 100, 400, 2, 10, 50, S_PAINR, S_DEATHR, \"a rhino\", \"monster/rhino\", NULL},\n\nto this:\n\n{ GUN_SLIMEBALL, 18, 70, 2, 70, 100, 400, 2, 10, 50, S_PAINR, S_DEATHR, \"a rhino\", \"monster/rhino\", NULL},\n\nHave fun fragging :)\n\n(edit: HTML hates \"<\" signs and thinks they're code)\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nMaybe it's just me. But, I've never been able to find a comprehensive list of cubescript commands. Most of the tutorials I've found are limited to the same dozen or so. Does anyone know where I can find a more complete list/tutorial?\n\nI'm including a list I created a while ago. (At least 1, possibly 2, years ago.) This was an attempt to collect it all in one document. I'm not sure if any of the command syntax has been changed in the latest version of Sauerbraten.\n\nFor those worried about legalities... The majority of the text is from the readme files that came with Sauerbraten. Some of it came from tutorials that were posted for free public use. (My apologies to the Authors. But, since I made it for my own use, I failed to keep track of their names.)Though, I did redo the examples for the string commands. Now, they will give you the right results. Finally, there are a few that I made up myself. For commands I discovered in these forums or reading the .cfg for various maps.\n\nI give my permission to use/modify this document. With the understanding, that I did not create the majority of the text. If anyone wants to update/maintain this document... Better you than me. I'm too much of a dilettante. Just post a link to it, please.\n\nThanks.\n\nP.S. I couldn't figure out how to get the auto TOC/Index to include a hyperlink. It was my intention to add them manually, once completed. (If wishes were horses...)\n\nSorry about the file... Won't let me upload a .odt file. So, I did a quick format change... Bad Idea... I'll clean it up & repost it.\n\nCleaned up the file.

The game's supposed to involve some puzzle solving and it's important for the player to be able to move around at a speed that feels a little more realistic and that makes it a little easier to look carefully for the solution to the puzzle. I've looked all around in various parts of the code for movespeed or maxspeed or something like that, but no luck. I checked out all sorts of tutorials online as well, but I couldn't find anything that worked with the game's current version. I know I could just lower the gameplay speed, but I'd rather just reduce the default speed to about half of what it normally is if that's possible.\n\n‹ Blendmap creation errors \"Your application for an account is currently pending approval\" ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "author": "Suicizer | 2013-12-11 12:22",
    "image": null,
    "content": "AssaultCube | Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Cube 2 (Tesseract) | Red Eclipse | Other Mod | Guide\nIn this guide, the meaning and the best position of gamemode entities will be described. This guide is suitable for editors which use any game that runs on Cube Engine (2), but examples are applied on Sauerbraten.\n\nWhat is a gamemode entity?\n\nIn common terms, gamemode entities are entities which are required for only certain gamemodes. Certain of those entities are:\n\nBase\nFlag\n\nAny other entities which affect the core gameplay are not considered as gamemode entities as the objective of the gamemode can be achieved without them or they can't be modified in the mapping process.\n\nEntity explanation\n\nThe base entity only appears activated in the modes Capture, Regen Capture and Hold (plus it's variants).\nIn Capture and Regen Capture, they represent a certain area which should be defended but attacked as well. In both modes, the base entity generates ammunition which can be obtained and consumed.\nIn the mode Hold, a flag spawns randomly on top of the base entity (only 1 flag in the entire map). This flag should picked and kept for 20 seconds which eventually earns a point to the team which succeeded that.\n\nThe flag entity appears in a lot of modes, currently Capture The Flag, Collect and Protect (plus all of their variants). In all modes, the flag entity is the most important entity throughout the game. The only difference is to bring the flag of the opponent to your base in CTF, while you score if the flag of the opponent has been brought back to their flag-entity in Protect. In Collect, you bring the skulls of killed opponents to your own base and earn points that way.\n\nPositioning the entity\n\nThe position of both entities is a little different. This will be explained in the next couple of aligns.\n\nHow not to place the entity\n\nI will only take examples which refer to to the position that is gameplay related. Positions which are content related (like floating in the air) are not referred. All examples are described as much as a separate and individual entity.\n\nBase\nThe position of a base should not be:\n- In a dead end, as you could only attack the base from 1 side (which makes it nearly impossible to conqueror).\n- With multiple paths towards the base. Because the base has a high chance of always being attacked. There is nearly no chance of gaining any ammunition as the base can be constantly attacked.\n- Near playerstarts (and vice versa). That would force players to start at that specific base at all times. Let them choose which way they want to go and rather place the playerstart somewhere between certain bases.\n- In an area which has no cover at all. This makes players vulnerable at all times. They need some place to be safe for just a moment to regain ammo and health.\n- Within range of another base. By letting multiple bases be in contact with each other (as in visual contact, but through gameplay as well), those bases are nearly impossible to conquer also. A good example is the map face-capture, which makes it nearly impossible to capture the base in the centre when any of the bases outside contains riflerounds or even rockets. However, if none of them contain so and rather spawn shells, grenades or even bullets, it is way easier to conquer the base in the centre as the players which defend the base are forced to leave their other bases to protect the one in the centre.\n- Nearby regular gameplay entities like a quad, healthboost, yellowarmour, greenarmour or even health.\nSo by placing the base entities not in areas which match any of the listed criteria above, the gamemode is flowing a lot better as the rotation between bases that are being conquered happens a lot faster.\n\nFlag\nThe position of a flag should not be:\n- In an open area which only provides cover to defend. This creates a situation where any attacking players have no proper opportunity to get the flag and head back to their own base.\n- In an open area which only provides cover for the attacker. This also creates a problem when playerstarts are nearby the flag. If not, it's not that big deal but still shouldn't be preferred.\n- In an area which requires skill in movement to pick up the flag. Give newcomers a chance to get the flag as well.\n- In an area which is deadly even without any opponent. For example above death or lava material.\n- In contact with the other flag in gameplay and visual aspect. It's such a waste to pick up the flag (or skulls), run all across the map, nearly scoring at your own flag (or skulls) while an opponent just frags you from their own flag with minimal effort (instead of hunting you down all the way).\n- In an area which contains a lot of playerstarts. This also decreases the chance to finally get the flag of the opponent and head out the base as you have to kill opponents often more than twice (first while entering the base, second while leaving the base and probably third while trying to reach your own base).\nSo by placing the flag entities not in areas which applies to any of these criteria above, it makes it way easier to obtain and score the flag and there fore play the mode as intended.\n\nHow to place the entity\n\nAlso in this case, I will only take examples which refer to the position that is gameplay related. Positions which are content related (like floating in the air) are not referred. All examples are described as much as a separate and individual entity.\n\nBase\nThe position of a base should be or contain:\n- 2 or 3 entrances and exits. This provides enough chances to deal damage to any player standing at the base while still surprising the defending player.\n- Close enough towards each other so you can still protect a certain base after standing at another (to prevent of fully capturing by the opponent). Of course not all bases need to be within walk distance of each other, but the most nearby should.\n- Far enough from another base so it shouldn't be in contact with each other in gameplay aspect. So they may have visual contact, as long as both bases provide ammunition which is only useful on short or mid range (while both bases are positioned on a further distance).\n- Some playerstarts with a proper distance away from it. Let players run for a few seconds towards a base so they have the choice how to navigate.\n\nFlag\nThe position of a flag should be or contain:\n- Enough entrances and exits towards the area of the flag, preferable 3 or even 4.\n- A good chance to pick up the flag and score at your own.\n- Some playerstarts with a proper distance away from it. Let players trace the opponent before they finally take him down.\n\nAll information provided within this guide may be used as a base to create other guides, articles or as reference within comments, replies or any other conversations, as long as it's about a similar topic and the original author is credited.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Stable | Deathmatch | Small (1-4) | GNU GPL v3\nBlurb A Deathmatch Tournament Map\nScreenshot \nGet original file (490KB)\nDetailed description\n\nInformation\nAfter starting the project back on the 20th February 2013, it took quite a while to get this map ready for release. I've tried to get the best results in layout, gameplay, flow, details, texturing and lighting while not redoing most things.\n\nThe map is designed to play duels with persons that think a bit while navigating as well. If that's a skill which you lack, playing it against up to 8 players in Instantgib or 2 on 2 in Teamplay would suit you a lot more.\nThe key of this map is to control the centre. Although the map looks closed due walls blocking your vision, you can predict quite accurate from which doorway you'll opponent will appear after you ran the map for a second time. However, there's a shortcut to each of the outer rooms to avoid the centre.\nBecause of this rather closed approach on a layout, you don't particullary need a high accuracy, rather some sense instead.\n\nNewcomers should feel home so too (even in Free For All), as you can recover health and grab some armour at each side of map, while the opponent tries to launch some explosives in the room for return.\n\nBots should play quite well. I couldn't find any major problems as like not reaching the armours, not getting certain pickups, just standing still at a certain playerstart, etc.\nThe map contains 3 bases, to experiment with Hold and Capture a bit. Should be quite fun to try out.\nIt has been PVS culled for maximum performance on all hardware, so even one of the most crappy laptops should be able to render it.\n\nI've tried to sketch a dry egyptic ruined theme. It's up to you if this is actually performed...\n\nFeel free to leave a comment, but be sure to check out the map first.\n\nSide Notes\nThis map requires the Soc's Egyptian Texture Pack to load correctly. I won't include the textures within this map as the license won't let me do so (I rather not release the map under GPL version 2 or any later version as the license permits so).\nThe link to the original content is right here.\n\nCredits\nI would like to thank Simon O'Callaghan for the textures and Razgriz for creating some accurate configuration-file (which of the map is based on).\n\nTo-Do-List\n- Add more details so it looks (even) more ruined.\n- Tweak the texturing a little bit.\n- Tweak the fog(dome).\n- Tweak the lighting.\n- Include the custom textures within the map itself.\n- Update the screenshot.\n\nImprovement-List\n2th of January 2014\n- Added more broken details (as like missing bricks) to the lower floor.\n- Made a gab in the curved wall between the YA platform and the centre of the map for more overview.\n- Lowered the upper gab between the centre and the catwalk. You can reach the other side of the map by some low skilled trickjumping in an immense short time.\n- Added a plank from the catwalk to the platform which is connected to the spiral staircase, for a better flow (and it's quite a nice detail, isn't it?)\n- Did nothing towards the lighting or fog, it feels right to me. If you share an other opinion, feel free to share your parameters.\n- Changed the weapon placement a bit; 1 box of grenades has been replaced for some riflerounds and some grenades and shells has been switched.\n- Reduced the mapsounds drastically, they shouldn't be that loud anymore.\n- Licensed the node as GPLv3 now. If you dare to use anything without giving any credit (as well as modified versions), you will get crushed by one of the bricks in this arena.\n\nMap file lost_soul_2jan14.zip (483.4 KB)\nRating\n43\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nI've come to realize I'm just not cut out for this map-making business. I'm all about instant gratification, so it frustrates me when I can't make the brilliant map idea I have become reality within minutes. I get bored, and say \"I'll finish it later.\" But when later comes I find that I'm still bored with the project and just end up scraping it. I've started hundreds of projects only to give up after an hour or so of work on it. And what I've come to realize is that I'm just not very creative. I can come up with a broad idea in my head, but then all the details are left blank and I've got nothing to work with. So I do what any uncreative person does when they need an idea, look at other people's work for inspiration. Then I say \"that was a bad idea, because now I REALLY feel inadequate about my creative ability.\" What avenue I have left is to take maps from other games that already exist and remake them in Sauerbraten. It's been done before, right? face-capture is still pretty popular for ctf and it comes from Ut-2004 (though even that version was a remake of the one from the first Unreal Tournament.) Anyway that's gotten me nowhere so far because this place is all crazy about licensing and I used textures that I wasn't supposed to and something something legal hooplah. I could go retexture the map with Sauer's regular textures but that sounds like a lot of work and it was hard enough to texture in the first place. So my give up, no more maps from me (probably.)\n\n‹ Windastella Workshop Curving the water/ lava/ glass materials ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Right now it's in kind of an early playable phase. I'm uploading it here to get feedback on how I can improve the map and make it more... better :P\n\n--General info--\nThis is a decent sized map, meant for 6 or more players. There's a few open spaces with multiple levels and lots of interconnected rooms. I mainly used ramps for getting from one level to another (though there was one place I had to use a jumppad.) There's lots of places to restock on health and ammo, and control of the upper levels can be key to victory.\n\n--Theme--\nAs the name suggests, water is a big part of the theme. It's a dark, rainy environment. Apart from that it's sort of a blend of ancient stone walls and mechanical/industrial bits (for lighting, mostly.) There are parts of it I'm not terribly fond of that need to be reworked, but for the most part I'm still liking it.\n\n--In Progress--\nI still need to finish lighting the place, it's supposed to be kind of dark, but not that dark. I also feel like there's some balance issues, in that I tend to go a bit overboard in my weapon and powerup placement. And I'm not going to lie, I'm not the most artistic person in the world, so adding all those little details that make the map feel more realistic is a bit of a challenge for me. Hopefully the critiques I get here will help me with that. I'm open to any suggestions you have on how to improve\n\n--Legal--\nNot too sure about the license I used, feel free to tell me how wrong I am. But really I don't care how you use or distribute this map as long as you give me credit.\n\nCan't wait to hear your feedback :)\n\nMap file hydrophobia.rar (750.14 KB)\nRating\n15\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Stable | Other License\nBlurb Additional Texture Pack to jf1\nScreenshot \nGet original file (304KB)\nDetailed description\n\nInformation\nSame story for this one as for the textures of ik2k and ikbase, I searched over the internet to see if they were still existing. Surprisingly, it was way easier to obtain them (although in .wad-file) than those of Fingers. There still was the problem of not being able to unzip a .wad file, but after using QuArK it wasn't so tough anymore (weird program though).\nThe website where I got them from is right here (somehow a doom-archive).\n\nThe textures itself were originally aimed for Quake 1, hence why the quality isn't that great (floor textures are only 128p, trims 32p and lights even 16p). Then again, what would you expect after 15 years?\nSo, the quality isn't outstanding, yet not that bad when used with textures of a similar size (or when aiming for a Quake 1 theme). You can always scale them down by half or quarter (to increase their pixel-appearance) if you want to.\nAlthough there have been stated that the texturepack includes 67 textures, I've increased the number by adding glow-maps (while 1 texture couldn't be ported to .png-format).\nThere is a second version of this texture pack (called jf2), but it has such restrictive license that there's no use to port it to any Cube Engine 2 at all.\n\nFor a better view of the screenshot, click here.\n\nCredits\nI would like to thank John Fitzgibbons for these missing textures.\nI don't need any credit for this at all and I'm not caring about ratings. I do care about if they would be used in one of your maps. So use them and credit John!\n\nLicense\nQuoted from the original license:\n\"you may use these textures in your maps, but give me credit if you do.\nYou may distribute this zip file on any electronic medium, as long as\nall files remain intact, including this text file in it's unaltered\nform. You may not make any money from these textures. I take no\nresponsibility for ANY damage resulting from these textures. I'm\nnot sure what kind of damage that could be...\"\n\nThe preview map is considered to be licensed as BY-NC-SA.\n\nTo-Do-List\n- Nothing, unless you come up with something.\n\nImprovement List\n15 December 2014\n- Added a glowmap for the jf_rbutn2 texture.\n\n16 January 2014\n- Updated the map to contain a better lighting (it previously was way too dark).\n- Updated the screenshot.\n- Added waypoints, playerstarts and pickups. Have fun playing a bit.\n\nAdvertising\nHere are some other texture packs which you might be interested in:\n\n\nMap file jf1_15dec14.zip (510.11 KB)\nRating\n10\npoints\n (3 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

If you do not have all of these set then the model will not use the code :)\n- I had to add md5env maps to inky and captaincannon, if you dont put these new md5.cfgs in, then they will not render (see note above)\n- Doesnt work for orgo (hes too old, and lacks the maps needed)\n- This formula can be simply modified to make a vary of effects :) the general formula is:\nif( dot(camdir, normal) (less than) mix(minedge, maxedge, max(camdir, normal){\ncolorout *= newcolor; //usually a percentage\n}\n\ndoing this multiple times causes cel shading, setting newcolor to 0.0 makes an outline :) petty simple.

This includes explosions that hit other players :)\nNew Damage Particle System: damage text is displayed a distance away from the player (dampartdist) rather than above the victums head, this allows you to see the damage done. Also in non-insta modes particle size and color is determined by the amount of damage done\nKill Feed: Renders in the upper left hand corner (where it use to) uses images to show kill types. Your kills stay up longer so you can see the carnage you are doing.\nNew chat console: New console in the lower left hand corner allows players to see old chat, but fades away when players do not have the console open.\nScore Board modifications: Shows person with the flag. Also shows players personal stats.\nTeam/Rival score menu: Allows you to see alive and dead players, and see where you are ranked in the bunch. In non-team mod acts like a normal score board.\nNew Hud Icons: New icons allows you to see where you flag is, (whether it is dropped or taken). Also shows progress of the flag and how close it is to being scored.\nTimer: on at the top center allows you to quickly tell how much time i left in the match.\nNew Cartoon Shader see http://quadropolis.us/node/4002.\nCommands\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndampartsize(-1..110..500) - distance that a damage particle is rendered (only when player1 is the attacker). smaller number smaller larger size, (remember that this is capped by the command maxparticledistance). A value of -1 turns this feature off and particles are rendered above the victim's head\nkillfeedlen(0..5..10) - determines the max number of items that can display in the kill feed. 0 turns the kill feed off.\nnameoverfade(-1..700..2000 - how long the name of your ally stays on the screen after you stopped pointing at him. -1 turns this feature off\nteammenu (0..1..1) - turns on and off the team menu on the right side of the hud.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE: this is all the commands I can remember if you find a command or are trying to turn off a feature than please leave a comment about it and I will try to help\nNOTE: many of the cfg files have been changed to cfgx files, you can still get your old setting by exec \"file.cfg\" and you can reinstate sauerx fetures by typing \"file.cfgx\"\nNOTE: my defualt.cfgx does not use sauers defualt settings, Many modifications are made to improve the aesthetics of this mod, if you wish to have your default settings back. or your person settings back just type exec \"config.cfg\" or \"data/defaults.cfg\".\n\nMod is in a fully working state there should be no errors, please report errors below.\n\nknown errors: none\n\nchasester\n\nscreenshot:\n\nRating\n34\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "AssaultCube | Cube | Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Cube 2 (Tesseract) | Red Eclipse | Other Mod | Guide\nIn this guide, the meaning and the best ways of flow within the layout of a map will be described. This guide is suitable for editors which use any game that runs on Cube Engine (2), but examples are applied on Sauerbraten.\n\nWhat is flow?\n\nIn common terms, the flow of a map is describing how a map feels while navigating through it. Some cases which effect the flow are:\n\nGameplay\nLayout\nAtmosphere (texturing, lighting, detailing)\nClipping.\nFlow explanation\n\nWhen a map has no flow, it means most of the times that it lacks some of the criteria which is listed in the next couple of aligns. Keep in mind that when you ignore some of the criteria, you may risk some serious flow issues on your map.\n\nAspect of gameplay on flow\n\nAs it should be clear to you what the core gameplay is (movement speed, jumping height, weapon recoils, etc), I won't put a lot of effort into that.\nI've listed most of the required measurements of all current games. All measurements are referred with gridpower 3 and are generally measured (not the actual limit, but a solid one). Trickjumps are ignored as the aren't part of the primary gameplay.\nAlthough the weapons which are being used throughout games matter a lot within the gameplay (thus the flow also); they won't be referred here as all games have their own documents for that.\n\nThe minimal height of ceilings and doorways is 5 cubes on Sauerbraten, Red Eclipse, Tesseract and Assault Cube (4 1/2 is still tolerable also, except on Red Eclipse).\nThe minimal width between walls or within a doorway is 4 cubes on all games.\n\nThe maximal height to jump on an edge is generally 2 cubes.\n\nThe best measures for stairs is 0,5:1 (so a half cube up, 1 cube long), but 0,25:0,5 works also (so a quarter cube up, a half cube long).\n\nThe maximal distance between 2 platforms which can be jumped (straight forward) from one to another is 12 cubes on Sauerbraten, 10 cubes on Red Eclipse, 8 cubes on Tesseract and 7 on Assault Cube (by using strafe-acceleration, else 4 1/2 cubes).\n\nThe maximal angle of a slope which can be walked on is 61,875° (a cube being pushed 5 times at front) on Sauerbraten and Red Eclipse, 56,25°(a cube being pushed 6 times at front) on Tesseract and none on Assault Cube as it is undetermined.\n\nAspect of the layout on flow\n\nAs the flow of a map highly depends on the layout, you should keep in mind for what kind of gamemode are you actually mapping.\nSome points will be described in the next sentence;\n\nSymmetry\nHeight\nLength\nOpenness\nConnections\nRealism\nPerformance\nEntities\n\nSymmetry\nThere is no place for such a thing in maps which aim for modes on Deathmatch or Capture. However, it often is preferred on maps which are oriented on Capture The Flag (as being more competitive towards maps which are asymmetrical while their goal is Capture The Flag as well).\n\nHeight\nIn a certain way, every type of gameplay needs some difference in height between rooms, areas or platforms. However, some gamemodes rather prefer not too much difference as it destabilizes it. For example, maps which aim rather for a simplistic gameplay like Instantgib should have less difference between platforms than maps which aim for a more complex gameplay like Free For All (as weapons like the grenadelauncher and rocketlauncher are more useful in such situation).\n\nLength\nThis may not matter a lot compared to the other points, but certainly shouldn't be forgotten. Long narrow paths (like hallways for example) never work well on any game. Keep the length of paths flexible and make sure there are enough connections to other paths.\n\nOpenness\nThis point matters also if the gamemode is more simplistic than complex. Maps which rather aim for Instantgib should contain less things to take cover behind (so like a hole-shaped layout in Deathmatch) than maps which aim for Free For All, which often have several rooms with individual weapons spawning within them.\n\nConnections\nThe connection between one room, area or platform to another should be taken wisely. The options on Cube Engine 2 are:\n\nStairs\nJumppads (not in Assault Cube) or Pushers (only in Red Eclipse)\nTeleports (not in Assault Cube)\nLadders\nElevators (only in Red Eclipse)\n\nIf the difference in height is considerably big, some stairs is often not the right choice. A better option is to use a jumppad, except if the difference is that big (or there is some required geometry between the two rooms, areas or platforms), then a teleport would fit better. If the approach towards the higher platform has to be silent, only then a ladder should be chosen, else use anything other than that. The reason for this is that a ladder can only be occupied by 1 person at the time (all other players won't be able to move further until the first user left the ladder). A jumppad or teleport only take a split second to use before some other player can use it also; which doesn't slow down the flow that way. The same counts for elevators; they can only be occupied by 1 person at the time (although more people could be elevated at 1 time), so it's not very flexible to use compared to jumppads and teleports.\nIf there's quite some difference in length between rooms, areas or platforms, a teleport is rather preferred than a jumppad. The reason for this is that teleports don't need a direct connection; you can move in the teleport from 1 side of the room, while spawning at the teledest at the opposite side of another room. However, you should take caution not to use too much teleports or jumppads, as they are directing players to a specific location, no matter if the player wants it or not.\nStairs are a good choice when the length and height is about to be equal and not too much. Long stairs are often considered as bad because players are a more predictable target than on solid ground.\n\nRealism\nWhile making a layout, realism should be chosen after the aspect of gameplay and flow. It is often forgiven that something isn't realistic yet flowing and increasing the playability, than being realistic and slowing down the flow (thus making the map less playable).\n\nPerformance\nThis topic is often overlooked while it surely matters. When making a layout, keep in mind you're using Cube Engine (2), which means you work with cubes. They may be pushed and pulled in about 56 different positions within the selection, it only makes it harder when using a lot of variety in it. Keep shapes simple. Most of the time, a texture which has the correctly specified shader-settings is even more effective than handcrafted geometry. If you really want to use some complex geometry, try to use mapmodels instead.\n\nEntities\nAs the position of entities that goes about playerstarts or other spawn-points which are part of the gameplay should follow the next couple of lines:\n\nNever put the direction of the spawn-point towards an object which blocks a straight forward path (for example a wall, boxes or even an edge of the area or platform spawning on as it will makes the player fall down while he has not chosen to fall down in the first place).\nNever put the spawn-point considerably high in the air. It's fine to let players fall down for a split second like at default positioning of playerstarts; but don't let it happen intentionally. As most of the games on Cube Engine 2 (except Red Eclipse) have no features to navigate accurately mid-air, players are hopeless floating ducks which can only defend themselves by shooting.\nPosition spawn-points some cubes away from objects (for example once more; walls, boxes or even an edge of the area or platform which the player spawns on). This gives players the opportunity to move all directions after spawning, so they have a proper chance of doing a counter attack towards their opponents.\nTry to place spawn-points spread over the map (even within modes like Capture The Flag!), as it spices up the gameplay due the fact of not being predictable where the fragged player will spawn again to counter attack their opponent.\n\nOn the next screenshot of ot within Sauerbraten is shown how spawn entities like playerstarts or teledests could be positioned correctly.\n\n\nAspect of the atmosphere on flow\n\nAlthough it has the least effect on the flow of a map, it definitely shouldn't left unnoticed.\nYou may want to create the most creepy place anyone has ever witnessed; be sure that paths and even corners within rooms are just enough revealed to see what's out there. However, keep in mind that the atmosphere should have enough contrast as well (in texturing, not just 1 colour; in lighting not all brighted but not all covered in darkness also).\nA good example on how it shouldn't be done is the next picture, which displays one of the rooms of the map within Sauerbraten; ph-capture. You can't see anything except the actual exits, but it's just a wild guess what you'll bump into while trying to reach it.\n\nAspect of clipping on flow\n\nThis is the very last step to do when creating a layout, as it happens to be combined often while texturing or detailing and even while being in the lighting process. Nevertheless, clipping exists to avoid players getting stuck or so they won't reach undesired places.\nAs some of the developers of Sauerbraten stated, it often happens they still have to fix several clipping issues which could have been whiped out by the mapper already. Some key hints to avoid such happenings are:\n\nAlways provide a wall of clipping material at each end of the map. This is just to be sure players won't reach the end of the map which makes them able to mess up the physics of the game and hack their selves through certain walls.\nAlways provide a ceiling of clipping material; but high enough so the player can't reach it by regular play (also not by using trickjumps!). The ceiling of clipping just to ensure players won't reach over the clipped walls at the end of the map.\nAlways try to fill all the space between the really end of the map and the wall of clip. The meaning of it is to increase the performance. How so? When using calclight or genpvs occlusion culling will be occurred (only on Sauerbraten and Red Eclipse). This calculates all cubes in certain views (also called viewcubes), so the map is already drawn (also called prerendered) from certain places. As cubes which contain any clipping material won't be calculated, it eventually saves file-size. Another reason to fill that particular space is to ensure no one is ever able to get through, up, under or next to the walls of clip (due mistakenly leaving a gab for example) and it also looks a lot cleaner.\nClipping material may be replaced for death material, as long as fits the theme of the map and feels natural. A fence which stands under a high voltage is pretty logical to die from when trying to jump over it. Even a wall of fog may be a pretty good cause.\nThis can be viewed in the next picture which displays the map renegade on Sauerbaten.\n\nIn a lot of cases, it is a good idea to use geometry which contains a sky-textured surface (by default textureslot 0). This is because that particular textureslot is also ignored when lightmaps are being calculated (it is even useful on Tesseract due the fact it will take the same rule into account). This is also to improve the playability of the map as it won't rely heavily on better hardware.\n\nAll points notified above about the aspect of clipping are displayed in the next screenshot of the map collusion on Sauerbraten (except for replacing clip material for death material). Players are unable to get behind it as everything between the wall of clipping material and the actual edge of the map is fully sealed.\n\nIn the next picture, a good clipped corridor (as in the map metl4 on Sauerbraten) is displayed. You practically won't get stuck anywhere while moving through it.\n\nAll information provided within this guide may be used as a base to create other guides, articles or as reference within comments, replies or any other conversations, as long as it's about a similar topic and the original author is credited.

    "content": "Quadropolis | News\n\nDear user of Quadropolis,\n\nOur website is frequently quite inactive which often is the blame of a policy performed by certain admins and moderators. There are a lot ideas which all have been listed on certain nodes, but they somehow never are really done (or never been finished). Click for an example right here or here.\n\nThat's why a new set of admins is upcoming, as most of the current ones which should be active are as inactive as the rest of the crowd. Therefore I would like to announce our newborn administrators:\n\n- Mmeaninglesz\n- Nyne\n- Ardelico\n- Chasester_aka_you\n- Calinou\n\nAs our beloved team of moderators is doing such a great job also; let's add some more to that team:\n- Windastella\n- Death14\n- Zaaikort\n- Pyccna\n- Greaserpirate\n\nLet's hope those fresh baked administrators and moderators show some results soon.\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "image": null,
    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Red Eclipse | Revelade Revolution | Sandbox | Guide\nThe Basics of Lighting\n\nLighting is one the most important parts in mapping for Cube 2. This article is directed to new mappers, who are not yet familiar with the very basic aspects of lighting. Most of it should apply for other Cube-Engine-based games (the default keys may differ, though).\n\nFirst I will introduce some basic commands, then I will explain the most important general light settings of a map. The following part deals with the usages of light entities. The last part contains some thoughts about the lighting-tab of the ingame menu.\nThe are way more commands and features which are involved within the lighting of a map, but I'll come to that later.\n\nI. Basic commands\n\n1. /calclight -1/0/1 - This command applies the changes you made to your map. The default key bind while editing in cube2 is \"K\" set at 0 (as the detail of calculation).\n2. /fullbright 0/1 - This command toggles between a lit and an unlit view of your map. The default key bind while editing in cube2 is \"L\".\n\nII. General light settings\n\nTo light up your map in an appealing way it is very important to set the following values the right way, because they determine the overall feel and atmosphere.\n\nWhen you have decided, what theme your map should have, you should choose a matching skybox. The easiest way is the ingame menu (esc/editing/skybox). Then you should set the following commands in a way that matches the theme and the skybox.\n\nRed skylight coming from a blue skybox or an intense skylight coming from a dark, nightly skybox do not make sense. Having a skybox that displays a sun, but setting no sunlight will make your map look strange, too.\n\n1. /ambient R G B\nThis value determines, how much and what kind of light the textures in your map emit. You can enter a value of 0-255 for each color (R = red, G = green, B = blue). \"/ambient 0 0 0\" will result in total darkness, while \"/ambient 255 0 0\" will give your textures an intense red touch. I myself prefer low ambient values, since this is the key to create contrast.\n\nYou will only see the effects of ambient, if one of the following settings is set or if you already have created a light entity.\n\n2. /skylight R G B\nThis value determines, how much light the skybox of your map emits. You can enter a value of 0-255 for each color (R = red, G = green, B = blue).\n\n3.a) /sunlight R G B\nThis value determines, what kind of light will be emitted from the direction of the sun in your skybox. You can enter a value of 0-255 for each color (R = red, G = green, B = blue).\n\n3.b) /getsundir\nThis command determines the direction, where the sunlight should come from. Just stand somewhere in your map, aim your crosshair directly at the sun and execute the command. It's useful to aim at the sun over an edge of a building, to estimate, what shadows the sunlight will produce at its current position. The following values will be displayed at the console:\n\n3.c) /sunlightyaw Y\nYou can adjust the horizontal position of the sunlight with this command.\n\n3.d) sunlightpitch X\nYou can adjust the vertical position of the sunlight with this command.\n\n3.e.) /yawsky 0-360\nThis commands rotates the skybox. It's very useful, if your skybox has a sun. You can rotate and put it where ever you want using this command. It does not affect the lighting technically, but it does in appearance.\n\nTo see the effects of the skylight and the sunlight, it is useful to temporarily set \"/ambient\" to a very low value. That way you can see the shadows very well due to the high contrast. It's also interesting to choose some extreme colour values as an experiment, just to get an idea of the results of those commands.\n\nIII. Light entities\n\nIf these settings are set, there will still be some dark areas like caves, closed rooms e.g. To light these up, you will have to set light entities.\n\n1. /newent light X R G B\nThis is how you create a new light entity. The X-value determines the radius. You can enter a value of 0-255 for each color (R = red, G = green, B = blue).\n\n2. /entselsnap 0/1\nThis command can help you to align your light entities properly. Set to 1, you can drag your entities aligned to the grid. The standard key bind while editing in cube2 is \"6\".\n\nNow, that you have made a light entity, it still needs a source, since it looks stupid, if light appears just out of nowhere. A light source can be a mapmodel (a torch e.g.), a particle (fire) or a texture (lamps, computer-desks e.g.) - anything, that would emit light.\n\nIt is very important, that the entity and the source match: a big source should emit much light, a small one should emit just a little bit of light. A red source should emit red light, a green source should emit green light etc. Generally, there shalt not be light sources without light entities and vice versa.\n\nTo make light sources look glowing, it is often a good idea to put one or more entities with a smaller radius right next to the source and another entity with a bigger radius (that lights up the room) in a bigger distance to the source.\n\n3. /vshaderparam glowcolor R G B\nThis command lets you change the colour of many lamp-/light-textures. You can enter a value of 0.0-1.0 for each color (R = red, G = green, B = blue). Just select the face/texture you want to colour and then enter the value.\n\nSpeaking of colors:\n\nPlain white light almost aways looks unrealistic and boring.\n\nIt is often better to give the light a slightly orange/yellow (warm feel) or blue (cold feel) touch. Lighting up the map with only one colour is boring, too. Next to the basic lighting tone, there should be a second, contrasting colour. I think the map nucleus (orange basic tone, some green contrasting lights at the computer desks) is a good example. Also the map complex has some blue, contrasting spots, which I think is a good solution.\n\nDo not overdo it, though: choosing more than 2 or 3 different colours will in most cases result in some noisy disco lighting-style.\n\nIV. The Ingame Menu\n\nIn most of the cases there is no need to touch the variables \"lighterror\" and \"lightprecision\". Just leave it, as it is. Those are only needed, if you like very hard, precise shadows or if you need to fix lighting errors in your map. But be aware: Lowering these values will drastically increase the filesize of your map.\n\nV. Other Stuff\n\nThere is a lot more to learn about lighting, such as spotlights, fog, watercolour, shaders and a lot of other commands/variables. And the described way is definitely not the only way to light up a map nicely, but if you focus on this way for the beginning, you are heading the right direction.\n\nAs a last thought keep in mind, that the technical knowledge about values, variables and commands is not everything and will not automatically lead to success. You need creativity and ideas also, but that cannot be described in a guide like this.\n\nLinks:\nList of commands and variables on Cube Engine 2: Sauerbraten\nTutorial by Hourences (not cube2-specific, but very interesting)",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Stable | Other | Creative Commons (BY-NC)\nBlurb Post FX that renders light shafts\nDetailed description\n\nLight shaft shader\n\nThis shader adds a flare-like effect for the sun which also casts light shafts. I learned about the method from this tutorial.\n\nThe way this shader works is like this. First, it detects which pixels are sky - this should be done using the z-buffer but because that is unavalible in Sauerbraten right now I instead detect sky using brightness. Second step is to apply radial blur originating from the sun's location. This is the most hardware intensive step. The third and final step is to blend the blurred sky over the original scene.\n\nAn important part of this effect is also a cubescript loop which calculates the sun's position on the screen and passes it to the shader. The calculation requires transforming the sun's angles to a vector, rotating the vector according to camera angles and projecting it to the screen. Huge thanks to my brother for explaining the math and making this part work for me.\n\nInstallation:\n\nCopy lightshaft.cfg to your game directory and then add \"exec lightshaft.cfg\" into your autoexec (you can do this in-game).\n\nWhen ingame use the command /lstoggle Q which will toggle light shafts on and off. Q is the optional quality of the radial blur (100 is the best quality). Valid range is 10 to 100, and by default it is set to 50. You can also add \"lstoggle\" into your autoexec to have lightshafts on all the time.\n\nDo not use addpostfx to start the shader - it requies a cubescript loop to update the sun's position.\n\nUpdate 28.8.2014\n- lightshafts are only rendered near sun, thus creating a flare\n- lightshaft center is no longer calculated from sunlight direction, instead it is set to the sun's (or moon's) position in each skybox\n- Q in lstoggle Q now controls the quality in percentage instead of number of passes for blur. This means that setting the quality to 50 in new lightshafts results in better quality than 50 in old lightshafts\nThese changes cause lightshafts to work with nearly every daytime map and even with some night maps. They also add a glow flare-like effect to the sun. Plus only rendering lightshafts near sun improves performance.\n\nUpdate 28.9.2014\n- Optimized! Mainly \"if\" removals (GPUs don't like ifs)\n- Sun is now slightly colored\n- lstoggle has a second parameter which controls the maximum number of checked pixels (like in the first version of lightshafts)\n- lightshafts are now turned off on skyboxes without sun\n- lightshafts will use sunlight as the sun's position on custom skyboxes\n- added comments to the shader code\n\nMore pictures:\n\nPreview\n\n(script not available for preview because quadropolis doesn't like greater-than and less-than signs)\n\nConfig file lightshaft.cfg (7.18 KB)\nRating\n72\npoints\n (8 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\n\nOkay, think about this: in the german language, \"ei\" is pronounced like the word \"eye\" or simply the word/letter I. Why german? Well, I am a native german speaker.\nAlso, a more valid reason is this: Sauerbraten is a german dish. Literally translated it means \"sour roast\", so I think using german pronounciation is a legit assumption.\nThe second thing is that in german, the \"U\" can be pronounced in different ways, for example like the \"OO\" in some words. Examples for the pronounciation I mean would be \"cool\" or \"mule\".\n\nTaking both together, it would mean that \"eihrul\" sounds like \"I rule\". Coincidence? I think not.\n\nEihrul is AFAIK the current lead developer of Sauerbraten and Tesseract. Eihrul hosts important Cube2 sites, for example sauerbraten.org. Eihrul is the one who is responsible for the global authcodes. Eihrul hosts the masterserver.\nIf he wanted, he could have a tremendous impact on the community.\nThat all means that eihrul indeed rules. Perhaps his nick was meant to reflect that?\n\n‹ Cardinal Directions Anttweakbar GUI Integration (WIP) ›\n\nRating\n1\n point\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "General Discussion\nExasperation intensifies\n\nI've never been so disgusted by a group of people in this game in any of my 8 years of playing. I'm so sick of some players acting like they completely comprehend a community that has been altered over the course of many years and target a certain group (\"old players\") as the cause for it's deteriorating quality, without actually playing the game for as long as the people he/she so criticizes.\n\nIt's pathetic to see people act so high and mighty when they behave like they are doing the community a favor because they \"give noobs a chance and try to teach them\" while other players don't necessarily share the same attitude. This is just wrong. There are many old players who have been around long enough in the community to actually be exhausted with the way some new players act. If someone doesn't know something simple, such as a matter pertaining to game play, of course any decent player would help. And if it's something not so simple, then the \"old players\" do not have to be responsible for that person learning what they want. If that person actually WANTS to learn about the game, then maybe, just maybe they will overcome their laziness and go and look for the answers by his/herself (As many players have done). But guess what. No player anywhere wants to deal with a new player acting like a little shithole kicking people for fun, spamming a server, and generally acting like an idiot for the hell of it. Of course people will then begin to ignore such people and that is ONLY the fault of the new players who act like they are 5 years old. There is no blaming of the \"old players\" for ignoring them because we are NOT responsible for the immaturity of others! There is a certain level of it that is understandable (like making play maps to get a feel for the editor), but when you begin to act like a fool, then you deserve to lose your credibility (if you had any to begin with) and people won't want to put up with your lack of common sense and lack of adequate etiquette.\nThose who are new players and actually WANT to become part of the community in a mature, positive and contributing fashion will do so on their own and thus will be respected and listened to accordingly. And I say that the rest of the people who act like they couldn't give two shits and like dirt-for-brains assholes just because they want to should be ignored and encouraged to leave the community. I've been playing this for a long time, not necessarily making maps, or becoming a star-quality fighter, but I have made many friends and enjoy watching players grow and develop their skills and playing with my friends, so I understand this exhaustion from old players who don't care to deal with people who join just to ruin the spirit of the game. So stop whining about their \"attitude\" and learn to distinguish between a player who is actually trying to be a part of the community and someone who joined just to act like a child and then deal with these people accordingly.\n\nMany old players have quit or significantly reduced their time playing here partially because of the reasons mentioned above, which I find sad, so I hope the attitudes in this community begin to change eventually.\n\nAs a little side note: I've been reading on Quadropolis for many years now and although I have never posted anything, I understand some people here love to take something someone else has written and attack that person for their opinion and views. If you don't agree or respect the things I've written above, then be mature and respond with some dignity. If you do however want to post a response exemplary of stupidity, be my guest, but unfortunately for you it will be to no avail (But feel free to entertain us anyway).

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten)\n\nTHE POOR MAN’S GUIDE TO CREATING HUDGUNS\nThis guide goes over how to create a simple hudgun for Sauerbraten.\n\n\nI. Whatchu’ Need\nII. Building Your Mesh\nIII. Mesh Revision\nIV. Texturing\nV. Export\n\nI. Whatchu Need\nFor this simple guide we’ll be using Sauerbraten, Blender and Noesis (unless your Blender/3D Modeler supports MD5). Easiest step.\n\nII. Building Your Mesh\nNow you’ll need your imagination, or an idea.\n1a. Build your model in sections in Sauerbraten to later be arranged in your 3D Modeler.\n1b. Build your entire model in Sauerbraten.\nHere is an example from one of my older projects.\n2. Delete the floor beneath your model (I like to replace it with a clip volume)\n3. Save your work and use command /writeobj. This command will export the entire map as an obj format. On Windows 7 it will be saved under C:\\Users\\[username]\\Documents\\My Games\\Sauerbraten\n\nIII. Mesh Revision\nNow open up your obj file into your 3D Modeler and make any revisions you wish. This is where you’ll arrange your mesh pieces if you chose step 1a in the previous section. I generally replace cylinders with Modeler-generated ones as Sauer can’t make good cylinders.\nHere is an example from an older project. Note that it is positioned for a direct Sauer port.\n\nIV. Texturing\nThis is the hardest part and I completely suck at it. See Blender or your 3D Modelers’ tutorials for this part. Just note that if you do not unwrap your mesh, your skin will be stamped throughout the model.\n\nV. Export\nThis step is only necessary if your 3D Modeler does not support MD5. MD5 Exporter for Blender 2.6+\n1. Save your model and export it to obj. (Ignore if MD5 Compatible)\n2. Open up Noesis and Export the model from Obj to MD5Mesh. (Ignore if MD5 Compatible)\n3. Open up the folder of the weapon you wish to replace, on Windows 7 it will be under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Sauerbraten\\packages\\models\\hudguns\n4. Replace the MD5Mesh file, texture files, and delete all DLL files. If you don’t want to write up a cfg file, you’ll have to keep the same filenames, but you’ll have to position your model for direct port so it lines up with the arms.\nHere is an example CFG from one of my older projcts.\n5. Test your creation! If it doesn’t look quite right, keep trying. It took me a while just to get my first one down, and it’s still not perfect.\n\n/endtutorial\n\n\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Revelade Revolution | Release | Final Release | Other License\nBlurb Interview with Developer of Revelade Revolution: Bigfootzz.\nDetailed description\n\nHey guys, recently I have been assigned as an interviewer to hopefully shed some light back upon quadropolis. This is my first interview, hope you enjoy! I tried to keep it brief so it won’t take too long to read. For those of you who don’t know who Bigfootzz is, he is one of the developers of another CubeEngine game named ‘Revelade Revolution’. If you could take the time to read this, I’m sure it would be much appreciated. If you wish to contact the Revelade Revolution crew, you can find them at #Reveladerevolution @ irc.gamesurge.net or contact them at their website: http://rr.theintercooler.com\n\nHow long have you been involved in the CubeEngine community?\n\nI started in the Cube engine community about two months or so before I started Revelade Revolution and we have been developing it for at least 2 years.\n\nFor the people who haven't heard of your project yet, give a brief summary of what it is.\n\nRevelade Revolution is an open-source First Person Shooter (FPS).\nThe game features fast-paced gameplay in both multiplayer and single player modes.\nPlayers are faced against swarms of zombies who have recently overtaken the city and are slowly spreading across the world.\nJoin up with other survivors as you battle not only zombies but other survivors looking to take the little resources you have.\n\nWho is involved?\n\nWe have lots of people on our team, I am the project manager, killme is our lead coder, TheAssassin is our server admin, crapimdead and Snipergoth are our mappers.\nWe also have Windastella, A_W_O_L_ and Snipergoth as our modelers and TimoV as our music and sound effects person.\n\nWhere can people contact you and check any progress being made on the game?\n\nThey can visit our site at http://theintercooler.com there are links to our Desura page there as well.\nThey should also check out our IRC channel at irc://irc.gamesurge.net/ReveladeRevolution.\nThat's where the real magic happens.\n\nWhen did you start to develop Revelade Revolution and when will you plan on releasing it?\n\nWe started development of the game about 2 years ago, currently it is in alpha but it is mostly stable and playable for sure.\nI am not sure how soon it will be until it is out of alpha as we do plan on adding some more major features for the next alpha releases before we can go to beta.\nWe don't have fixed release dates since our coders are all volunteers and thus aren't available for coding all day, but we usually try to release as soon as the situation allows us to do so.\n\nHow is the project coming along?\n\nThe project is coming along great.\nThe next Revelade Revolution release will include a lot of bug fixes as well as new models.\nWith the increase in interest in the game we have been working very actively over the last few months.\n\nDo you need help with anything in particular that someone on quadropolis could assist you with?\n\nYes, the most important task to accomplish is getting new maps for the game. The ones that are included at the moment are just a temporary solution.\nBut really any help from the community is appreciated.\n\nWhat/Who inspired you to develop Revelade Revolution?\n\nI've always loved video games and always wanted to make one.\nOnce I found Sauerbraten I decided it was time to try it.\n\nHave you come across many complications in the development of Revelade Revolution?\n\nYes. one of the complications for our team, besides effectively working together as a team, was getting the game to work across all major platforms.\nCurrently we support Microsoft Windows and Linux, but we've been working on Mac OS X support for a few weeks now.\nWe still have to finish our automated build system to build Mac OS X versions, too, before we can create release tarballs for this operating system.\n\nWhat will be unique inside of Revelade Revolution that isn't already apart of another Cube Engine game?\n\nThere are a lot of stuff we have added that other Cube engine games don't have.\nFor example, we have a class based system (similar to TF2), we have controller support built into the game and we are working on integrating clan related stuff such as clan war support or global text chat into the actual game.\n\nWhat have you and your developers got in mind once you finish RR?\n\nWe'd like to have a feature rich, player oriented shooter played by a large community.\nThe people shall enjoy playing Revelade Revolution, that's why we appreciate suggestions by them.\n\nDo you have any other projects?\n\nWe are currently helping another developer with his game called Grim Quest.\nIt is a point and click style RPG.\nWe have also recently taken over development of MekArcade, a game that was originally planned to be an expansion of Red Eclipse, that will now be recreated from scratch in our new engine (a fork of tesseract).\nWe also have plans for an MMORPG called Broken Shield but that is a way off at this point.\n\nIs there a stable version of RR available for download?\n\nThe game is very stable, you can get a download link on the project's website http://rr.theintercooler.com.\nThere you can find a link to our Desura page as well a link to our Sourceforge project.\n\nThanks a lot Bigfootzz and the rest of theintercooler members for their contribution.\n\nDeath14\n\nRating\n54\npoints\n (7 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Help and Support\n\nI was wondering if anyone could help with some scripting. Pretty simple stuff really, or at least I think so, but I really know nothing about cubescript to make these myself.\n\n1. If anyone could make something that hides all of the HUD (as with the /hidehud command) but without hiding the crosshair. Hidehud 1 hides everything including the crosshair, and I'm not sure why, but I would like to still see the crosshair when using this command. The only thing I could think of was a script with all the commands to hide everything seperately (like, consize 0, miniconsize 0, showfps 0, etc.) but I don't know how to make it a, uhhh, \"toggle\" bind?, where one key would turn these things both on and off.\n\n2. A zoomscript. I don't like how when you zoom in in Sauer you see just the tip of your rifle, or whatever else you have equipped. Maybe this is my A.D.D., but it would be nice to have a command that simply just changes my FOV to something lower and then back, instead of the togglezoom command.\n\nAnyone who could possibly make these, please let me know. I'm sure they are easy. Also feel free to share them, they don't have to be just for me. :)\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n‹ Problem with Minimap & motionless Bots Rants Thread ›\n\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Pickup changes. Changed custom \"sheik\" cell textures back to original Meister \"Hex\" textures.\n\n--------Edit 12/27/15--------\n\n-Updated map\n\n--------Edit 2/5/2015--------\n\nIt has been a while since I posted anything on this map, as it was seemingly done. Of course that is never the case, so I have been hard at work again on this child of mine. Attached here (pandora_update3.zip) is the newest version. I think I can say it is (really) finished this time. I don't think any further updates will be made, or any other suggestions added. Instead, go and play the final product!\n\nTo make it compatible with the Inexor project, I had to replace two textures with ones I created on my own; they are included in the zip, so be sure to put them in the right places.\n\n-------Original Post--------\n\nThis is a CTF map I have been working on. It includes flags, pickups, and bases for capture modes.\n\nIMPORTANT: The map requires Yves Allaire's \"eX\" Texture pack, which can be found here: www.quadropolis.us/node/2792. If you need help figuring out where to put the textures, please refer to the guide I wrote up on the sauerworld post: http://sauerworld.org/forum/index.php?topic=32.0\n\nTheme: A laboratory that has managed to open Pandora's Box, only to unleash all hell and leave the area vacant.\n\nThanks to:\n- Yves Allaire for the textures.\n- Pyccna, for his help again with much of the geometry, lighting, details, and the lava texture.\n- rabe, for advice on lighting and texturing, which were used on this map.\n- Doko, for advice and tips in game on geometry and details.\n- Skur, for general advice on the map.\n- Savanha, feedback on the flow and layout.\n- Frosty, for spending countless hours on the map as I edited, giving suggestions.\n- Everyone else who helped in anyway, through suggestions, advice, or testing.\n\nStill to do:\n- Fix some texturing\n- Fix exterior clipping\n- Fix some bugs\n- Improve lighting\n- Find better roof lighting (instead of spamming the same light fixtures)\n- Improve on geometry and detailing\n- Overall polish of the map\n\nUpdate #1 9/9/2014:\n\n- Changed half of the map's lighting to a shade of purple to differentiate between bases.\n- Remodeled side rooms for better flow and appearance, also moved green armour into them.\n- Extended center of map for longer flagruns and more room overall.\n- Got rid of the laggy particle and added new ones as suggested by Pyccna (though I changed them from your suggestion just a bit).\n- Deleted the teleports\n- A bit more interesting geometry/details.\n- Fixed .cfg problem for people who weren't seeing the lava texture.\n- Added health boost. Some people will complain about this, but I do these things to set my maps apart :). If you really want the health boost, you need to jump into the lava after getting it, so it keeps people from, dare i say, whoring it. You would be smart to wait until you are seriously weak already.\n\nUpdate #2 9/22/2014:\n\n- Probably too much to remember.\n- Completed to-do list.\n- Made some changes to the layout.\n- Made some changes to geometry.\n- Made some changes to details.\n- Replaced item spawns and playerstarts.\n- Created waypoints.\n\nUpdate #3 2/5/2015:\n\n- Re-textured entire map with the 512x512 version of the Yves Allaire eX textures.\n- Added a short wall along the side routes to give a little more cover to the middle/lower bridge.\n- Added two cat-walks from the lower bridge to the upper levels for more possibilities in navigation.\n- Re-worked the side armour rooms with a slightly more interesting layout, including a redesigned ramp and small pool with jump-able computers.\n- Got rid of the spammy floor-grate pipe line thing in the bases.\n- Filled the the open-sky pits with lava to match the middle.\n- Added various boxes to keep the flow more interesting.\n- Changed the jumppads to push you straight up, with no horizontal push.\n- Changed the particle to something more minimalistic.\n- Completely redid the item spawns and playerstarts, and switched the quad and healthboost. The quaddamage is now essentially useless, as it should be on such a small map.\n- Added base names.\n- Replaced two textures which were non-commercially licensed to allow compatibility with the Inexor project.\n- Added a \"pandora.txt\" readme.\n- Updated the map's .cfg and waypoints.\n\nMap file pandora.zip (0 bytes)\nRating\n94\npoints\n (11 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Stable | Mapping | Creative Commons (BY)\nBlurb Sandy7's script for ease of mirroring playerstarts on a mirrored map\nDetailed description\n\nRecently I had asked bum if he could help me create a script for editing. I wanted some way to copy all playerstarts from one side of a mirrored CTF map to the other and flip them 180 degrees to face the right direction. He made one that would do this, but it also would reset playerstarts with value \"1\" to 0s, so all playerstarts would be neutral and I would have to pick out the team playerstarts and switch them back. Like any impatient non-scripter would do (I think he wasn't around to fix it when I realized the problem), I asked someone else who knew scripting to try it out. Sandy7 created this script here, which will rotate playerstarts (or any entity you want) by 180 degrees (or any value you want), but will also change playerstarts with value \"1\" to value \"2\" for you, and keep 0s the same.\n\nSo this basically saves a lot of time when doing playerstarts. Instead of having to rotate each one by hand, or even recreating them all together, just do the following:\n\n1. Paste this script into your autoexec.cfg\n\n2. In game, select the side of your map with playerstarts.\n\n3. Type \"/entfindinsel playerstart\" , then \"/entcopy\"\n\n4. Select the other side of your map.\n\n5. Type \"/entpaste\" , then flip the entities with \"/entflip\".\n\n6. Type \"/rotateps1 (degrees) (enttype)\". For this case it would be \"/rotateps1 180 playerstart\"\n\nHope other people will enjoy this time saving script as much as I do.\n\nAll credits for this script go to Sandy7, with the original concept by bum.\n\nPreview\n// Config script\n\n\nrotateps1 = \" entloop [ if (=s (enttype) $arg2) [ if (= (entattr 1) 1) [entset (enttype) (+ $arg1 (entattr (0)))(2)] [entset (enttype) (+ $arg1 (entattr (0))))(0)][] ] \"\n\n//In-Game Command: /rotateps1 (degrees) (enttype)\n\nConfig file rotateps.cfg (226 bytes)\nRating\n9\npoints\n (1 vote)\nlogin to post comments",

Despite that, it took longer than expected as the layout had to be extended over and over again.\nI've aimed on the tournament deathmatch side of Sauerbraten, so prepare to use everything you've got when trying to frag that single opponent!\nThe atmosphere and details should bring you back to the days when everything wasn't that sweet looking when it comes to the textures. Then again, the quite curvy and smooth geometry, the textureblending and lighting should compromise this.\nJust give it a spin, try out this map and post some comment with certain feedback included!\n\nNotes\nDownloaded the custom textures before loading the map which can be obtained here!\n\nKnown bugs\nThe tele_curve model isn't alpha blended while it's configuration says it should and the skin contains an alpha channel. Whether this is a bug on Cube Engine 2 or some mistake within the skin or config-file; do me a favour and please look at it.\nThere currently is also a bug with the decalworld shader; you might not be able to see all decals when having a resolution lower than 1280x768 (you'll have trouble with that resolution as well). This seems to be a bug in the engine. Please report if you noticed the very same or anything different.\n\nCredits\nI would like to thank John Fitzgibbons for these forgotten textures.\n\nLicense\nThe map itself is licensed as BY-SA; so just credit me if you use anything from it and use the very same license for your work. That's all.\n\nTo-Do List\n- Add a cloudlayer.\n\nImprovements\n7 November 2014\n- Replaced red dominating lighting for blue or yellow lights.\n- Lowered the pit in the sewer to let grenades not hit you that easily.\n- Added clip next to the lava so you can jump up when getting stuck there.\n- Improved the flow by pushing the floor of the highest platform more inside the wall (should be more accessible from both sides now).\n- Replaced the dirt-texture jfrock.jpg for a way brighter one, dirt01.jpg (and dirt02.jpg) and brightened the jf_brick2.jpg ingame.\n- Increased the height of the glass tubes around the armours.\n\n15 December 2014\n- Added sounds.\n- Cleaned up some mess of the config-file and included the license and explanation within there.\n- Updated screenshots.\n\nURL https://www.mediafire.com/?i6u8zc66e76ric0\nRating\n66\npoints\n (9 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

You'll find yourself in an interactive, dynamic, non-euclidean world. Supported by 5000+ lines of Cubescript and GLSL code, this map will do things no other Cube 2 / Tesseract map has ever done before. Its theme and concepts are greately inspired by Antichamber and NaissanceE – great puzzle / exploration games with strong surreal atmosphere.\n\nYou can start Anticube 2 by loading the map ac2 (/map ac2). To have the best experience possible, please follow these recommendations:\n\n- Avoid using third person camera. It can break things.\n- Explore everything. There is no place from which you cannot return. There are many secrets hidden in the map.\n- Use your wits rather than brute force. Observe everything.\n- You don't need shooting in any way to complete the map. Don't shoot.\n- You don't have to solve everything. There are 10 cubes in the map, but you only need 8 to access The Core.\n- Use the SVN build of Tesseract if possible (and turn volumetric lighting on)\n- This map has music. Make sure you have your music on in the settings.\n- Turn your hudgun off (/hudgun 0).\n- Don't swich to edit mode until you have finished the map. It will be tempting, but please resist.\n\nNow you're good to go. Have fun!\n\nThe map uses many assets from various authors. You can see full credits in map's readme or at map's end area. Special thanks to TristamK and Fishgius for testing.\n\nScreenshots\n\nUpdate 14th March 2015\n+ Added collisions for rocks\n+ Added missing readme\n* Cleaned up outside parts of the map\n* Small fixes\n\nUpdate 19th October 2015\n+ Included revised scripts by RaZgRiZ\n* Minor terrain improvements\n* Minor bug fixes\n\nYou can now download the latest version of Anticube 2 on Github\n\nURL https://github.com/Kvaleya/Anticube2\nRating\n160\npoints\n (16 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

I would really appreciate any help, either by feedback here, or even some work in game and posting the results!\n\n-Fatality/sheik\n\nMap file averas.zip (1.99 MB)\nRating\n39\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Wonder why it happened so quickly\".\nAfter some months I've been wondering why there is no discussion on sauerbraten.org.\nNow I googled quadropolis.us and voila, you're still there. Just www.quadropolis.us is gone.\n\nHaving been on the interwebz for about 2 decades, I could imagine a few others being as stupid as me. So you might wanna do some forwarding of www.quadropolis.us.

(The fact that it has rm in its name and has similar textures to my map rm5 is a coincidence, both were started at around the same time and both grew into techSoc textured maps). Last week I showed my layout and start to texturing to Nieb and the two of us worked on finishing up the details of the theme and layout. The map is set built into part of a mountain with a single entry door jammed. The remaining Ogros are left to fend for themselves amongst the limited ammo and supplies of this sandy base under a blue sky.\n\nWith the help of much play testing online, I have found that this map is well suited for teamplay of 6 players, and is also very enjoyable for insta duels. I would recommend keeping the number of players below 6, especially for insta.\n\nSpecial thanks to all the people I asked for critique from on the cm|CubicMatter server, namely: Galaxie, Boxx, nopnotme, degrave, swatllama, Doko, Suicizer, Doom, Sheik, zoocata, and jangelelcary. I hope that you find that all of your criticisms have been answered sufficiently, but if not please let me know.\n\nI view this map as a sort of upgrade to rm5 and think that it flows very well and is pleasing to play on. Please comment with all kinds of feedback, praise, concerns, or criticisms.\n\nThanks\n\nNOTE: The skybox is not included and must be downloaded from skiingpenguins' website.\nFor installing the skybox, download 'zeus.zip' from the URL below.

A better way to get the map is probably to download the latest nightly SVN version at: http://mappinghell.net/tesseract/tesseract-nightly.zip\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy playing this map! It's definitely the longest I've ever worked on a single map, with work first starting over a year ago. Of course, I wasn't working for a solid year, but it still has taken a really long time!\nThe map works in all modes, although you need the latest SVN of Tesseract for it to function properly in teamplay, and take advantage of fancy graphical features like volumetric lighting! Also, this isn't a small map, although it is pretty compact. I would recommend at least 6 or 8 players minimum if you want to have a good time with this map, otherwise it can be hard to find each other.\n\nAlthough the map is already in the game, if you do notice any errors feel free to let me know, i'll try and get fixes included as soon as I can.

A fast paced intermezzo of a mess with a be-your-own-high-speed-train o.O (broken since collect =/). Zades train was built here and it had a train-by-diner. train train. :D No spec and no editmute, go figure... xD\nLatest version is lost, would be nice if someone had it! :D\n\nThe Green Hell\nthegreenhell.ogz\n\nA fun, ugly interlude to our coop sessions. No map drew more people with /sendto all and -~+. reverting to last backup! xD +~-\n\nMountain Ville\nmountain-ville.ogz\n\nSpy-HQ, first-class villa, future cube-corp equipment and a criminal vibe all over the place. Need I say more? :D\n\nYour Farm!\nYour-Farm!.ogz\n\nThe name says all: Your a farm in this one!! xOOO\n\nZombie Apocalypse - Chapter III : The Creepy Killinggrounds\nzack-LAYOUT.ogz\n\nA lot can be said about ZACK. Most of all, he's a terrific guy. Many of the best mappers out there still didn't hold back bending him in every which direction, though. o.O\n(10 employers leading 10 workers each was the idea. The layout is mostly done, and ZACK certainly deserves a node of his own... but will he ever?! DUNN DUNN DUNNNN)\n\nTristram\nTristram.ogz\n\nTrying to rebuild the Diablo 1 village as 1:1 as possible O.o By a very laborious Fe (99%) & a rather tired cat (0,5%, most of which amounted to inhabiting the nacho chair and/or overseer-tower! :D). My apologies... =/ Oh yeah, and the infamous AK 47-vehementi was born here! (by Snowy!) :D\n\nUntitled Prison Map\nUntitledPrisonMap.ogz\n\nFar out in the ocean lies a high security prison, for the worst mapping criminals unable to map in /gridpower 5 and bigger!\nWell actually, they're the ones mapping on sunny detail island while the poor cats have to slave away in unbearable heat, in the middle of the ocean. -.-\nAnyway... xD Add 80 inmates, 20 guards, very few space and you got yourself the newest layout of the zombie-crew.\nBut behold! Democracy! The plan was to have a vote-island to vote for name, tagline, prison- and guard-tower models, and so on, by everyone who participated. Naming suggestions so far are:\n- Alcatraz Island (no tagline)\n- Jailbroke: dedicated to all in, and afraid of, prison. In whatever form, fear or flavor it may come.\n- TheAlwaysUnifnishedPrison: welcome to this prison, in which will never be fully developed.\n\nCastello del spooky di mare!\nspooky-sea-castle.ogz\n\nOr something like that. My french isn't what it used to be. O.o Something about a wiener schnitzel or something. Don't ask me!! xOO\n\nMICROCITY\nMICROCITY.ogz\n\nAnother disastrous attempt in forcing people to want to map in /gridpower 5+ to spawn more and better layouts for unlaggy 100+ player MMO maps! :D And our last project so far...\n\nLicense?\nAll maps were built on public servers, and as always were free for everyone to join, /getmap, participate, etc, and all the things were made on or especially for them.\nBut there were hardly ever talks about licensing, as many considered it too much of a hassle. I hope it's ok to publish them as-is, just like they've been up on the servers for countless hours (I've dedusted them to remove most of the grief for you :D)\nI didn't know if I should credit everyone yet, maybe someone doesn't want to be mentioned, please let me know. And if you want something changed, removed or more/less credit, as always: please just drop us a note. :D\nAll copyright and trademarks belong to their respective holders, ofc =) And as far as I'm concerned, all my own work on them is under CC0 1.0 Universal.\n\nThis shall also be a shoutout to all my old friends, and to try to get UPM and ZACK the freedom they deserve! :D\n\nlove, meow! =)\n\nMap file zalc.zip (1.99 MB)\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

(+ how-to)\n\n1. Map direction\nThe tiny red cube on the bottom right corner of a selection points _south-east_. If you want to stitch sketches together one day, having directions in mind is key, as you can't rotate all textures and entities so easily.\n\n2. /allfaces 1 first\nCutting into grass gets you dirt, blowing a hole into a wallpaper brings out the bricks in the wall, etc :D The cube-engine is pretty special in 3D terms as in a way it can consider what something is made off. Maybe one day entire maps are destructible, and you're set for the future! :D Looks much better too, and a lot more solid.\n\n3. /gridpower 5 +\nBuilding and using material and textures only in /gridpower 5 and bigger (without /vcommands) on a map sized 11 makes it possible to rescale everything into a /gridpower 6 sized micromap laters. Which then can easily be delivered inside other maps, as an add-on or easteregg so to speak. :D\n\n4. Walls stay outside\nBuilding the walls around the insides - means: a corner is 3 from the outside resized /gridpower 5 + cubes, that are built around the 4th, inside cube, which itself is resized from below, thus making it the ceiling of said inside, as well as the floor of the storey above! O.o ... o.O .... JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAPS WILLL YA!!! xOO *pant*\nThis will keep your low-poly layout almost indestructible, as editing inside a house with tiny grid may only affect the ceiling(upper floor), and has little to no effect on the walls (unless they're edited, ofc o.O)\n\n\nStep it up another notch! 0.0 (#advancedmode)\n\n* 5. Everything by foot\nTrying to make every spot on the map accessible by foot, best without jumppads or teleports (hard: without pistol - nightmare: no jumping allowed!:D) makes the map more accessible and fun for everyone, especially explorers without edit-privileges!\n\n* 6. Big dreams on a small budget\n16.000 cubes max ( in /newmap 11 ). No more than 32.000 for /newmap 12, 64k at 13, and so on, in increasing difficulty... :D\n\n* 7. The empress/emperors new clothes\nYou heard it! 0.o A beautiful, free map shouldn't look too naked around the cubes! o.O Why not deliver a whole new free texture-set with it? :D www.gimp.org could make it happen!! xO\n\n* 8. Models, Inc.\nWhy not add free new map-models, while we're at it? :D (e.g. with blender.org - examples: blenderartists.org) - Possibly even rigged and animated? ;D\n\n\nLicenses:\nzade-forever.ogz: CC0 1.0 Universal\nzack.ogz: all my work on it is CC0 1.0 Universal.

    "content": "Content Creation\n\nMy grandson's spotted 'Sauerbraten' and were keen to play.\n\nI have had 'Sauer' installed for a long time and dabble in simple map making. There are a LOT of tutorials 'out there'. So many, in fact, that's it's quite difficult to pick which one.\n\nCan someone recommend a tutorial, document or video, on how to design and build, a simple single player game?\n\nI realize that my request is very broad, but I need to know, how to build a level from start to finish. Some areas that I need help with: Creating landscape (hills etc). Creating shapes like cylinders, pyramids, spheres. Oh and lighting.\n\nI would appreciate any references to books, documents, videos etc.\n\nThank you.\n\nJ\n\nps: Can 3D models be imported. If so, how?\n\nMaking games using Cube 2 ›\n\nRating\n18\npoints\n (2 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Even more.....\n\nwhile streaming my desktop or most likely playing Cube 2 Sauer Braten most of the time.\n\nThe game I started playing 6 years ago, building a Ship in which I hope to not only make a come back again. Also to complete it during my streams over time and later build something new. who knows maybe you guys can get your work or self's featured.\n\nAs always your more than free to send in some of your work to help out in the development of The ship\n\nI'm not sure how this will go so I'll give it a try later this summer. If it works out then maybe I may expand to new horizons.\n\nDon't forget to Like/Follow my page/Channel for more updates coming this summer\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/landriders7th\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/landriders7th\n\nlogin to post comments",

Some of you will go through all of them. Some of you stop at half. Some, to my deepest regret, will not pass a single one. But I’m sure that these maps will give you a lot of new emotions. In fact, most of these maps will be difficult to pass. Part of them is an experiment. Some of them are transferred from other games. And other maps better not to show people in Cube 2 at all XD. But like Cooper say “There are some true beauties in it!” so you should try some of them.\nDespite the reduced quality by YouTube and some my errors in demos “Procursu” as a race movie should be pleasant to watch.\nLink for maps pack is stored in the description.

    "content": "Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) | Release | Stable | Standalone | All Platforms | Creative Commons (BY)\nBlurb QServ Server Mod\nDetailed description\n\nHello everyone! I have been working on QServ since Trooper edition for almost 7 years now.\n\nQServ is a standalone server modification for Cube 2: Sauerbraten. It is completely compatible with Mac OSX, Windows & Linux. All of the server commands are written strictly in C++ 11 and C for compatibility and optimization, to update the code of the engine and remain mean, clean and capable. All of the commands are separated into a separate QCom.cpp file for optimization, ease of upgradability with Sauerbraten versioning, and organization. There is an advanced command handling system with little load on N_TEXT and the server. It is very simple to create your own command. Simply add a command in QCom.cpp and add it to the header QCom.h, QServ does the rest. The command handler has argument handling, safety checking, and much more. Tests have shown that QServ uses less than approximately 1% of your CPU. Also, there is absolutely no latency on home connections (0 ping). This is because the mod has stayed up to date with eihrul's latest changes to the Sauerbraten engine without causing bugs. The IRC bot can be enabled or disabled in the server-init.cfg with the ircignore command. Notable features are the smartbot IRC bot and #smartbot command which allow weather results by city, calculator results, dictionary results, translation, linking and much more. More notable features that set QServ apart from all of the other mods are its longshot and up close kill detection, its very small size, ease of use, and small memory usage.\n\nchangelog\nmain mod page\nwiki\n\nSome features include:\n- over 30 commands\n- up close and longshot kill detection with messages\n- pass the flag\n- server stored maps\n- killing spree detection\n- banner messages\n- banlist and ipban capability\n- full log with time\n- ability to enable/disable setmaster command live\n- rename imposters\n- kill anyone on the server ^.^\n- map sucks implementation\n- force intermission capability\n- get local time of server/uptime/os and generalized world timezones\n- IRC Bot (NEEDS DEBUGGING) with commands issuable from server like #weather los angeles, #calc 5+5, #dictionary sauerbraten\n- automatic map sending with lightmaps included\n- instagib-based gameplay on maps sent from server (client doesn't need to /get or /save)\n- accurate geoip location with geolite city\n- modify server-init.cfg variables while server is live with #reloadconfig\n- change servername, password, add banner messages, all while server is up\n- add authkeys from server or reload them from users.cfg (without restart)\n- invisible admin ^.^\n- and many other features\n\nURL https://github.com/deathstar/QServCollect\nRating\n0\npoints\n (0 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Plays well in insta, ffa, and effic. I started this project back in the summer and recently picked it back up sometime in the past two weeks. As of right now, it is done. However, all suggestions will be considered. Looking at the title, the map is meant to look the way it does. Little detail and no eye-popping textures are important attributes to the map. The flow on the other hand, is very smooth allowing the player(s) to circle the map with ease with no direct route to the middle. Once in the middle though, there are few quick escapes such a teleport and jumppad. The map was meant to look and play simple.\n\nMap file insipid.zip (1.12 MB)\nRating\n41\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Well he gets 1500 health, 1200 armor, and 100000 ammo. All he has to do is complete the objective (score flagruns/kill others/capture bases/hold the flag) and live for 10 minutes. If the others kill him before 10 minutes is up, he is defeated and another hulk is chosen.\n\nPlease tell me what you think and also come check out the mod in person on the va|Hulk.\n\nlogin to post comments",

See the included agtg.png to see which, and move back so all generated text will appear in your field of vision.\nIf you don't do this the generated text will be truncated to the part which can be generated in your view as you can only edit in sauerbraten on things which are inside your field of view.\nYou probably want to use the smallest grid size but bigger text is also possible. with the right face of the cube selected, enter this command:\n\n/agtg Hello World!\n\nas you can see, you don't need to put double quotes \"\" around your input. However, if you want to generate text with characters which are interpreted by cubescript,\nyou do have to put double quotes around your input and escape some characters. Characters which mess up up the input are: ^;()[]\"\nYou can escape these characters with a ^ in front. So for example, if you want to generate this string:\nthis is a string with a ] and a ; but which can still be generated.\nyou would use:\n/agtg \"this is a string with a ^] and a ^; but which can still be generated\"\n\nThese are all the characters which you can generate.

It is generally better to use grubfont to minimalize the wtr of your map.\n\nyou can select a font using /agtgfont nameofthefont\nso that is one of those two for now:\n/agtgfont grubfont\n/agtgfont grubfontbbg\n\nyou can autocomplete the font selection with tab.\n\nNOTES ON ADDING YOUR OWN FONT\nif you want to add your own font, you have to add another folder to your packages folder and use the savebrush command to save each character as a .obr file.\nFor every character, select it and for example for the letter a, use:\n/savebrush yourfontname/a.obr\nUse the same filenames as used in grubfont and add your fontname on line 13 of agtg.cfg so agtgfont selection can tab autocomplete it\n\nedit: I seem unable to add the zip file here.

YA would make extremely big difference on map this size (it makes it even on Academy), so there's no YA, and not to mention QD and HB. Only 1 jpad, and 21 player spawns.\n\nSome 21h of mapping went in this map, mostly because of details and changing theme of the map...

The gameplay knowledge combined with artistic vision could only result in a nice and playable map.\n\nBased on a layout drawing Gangler made, I started building on the 30th of August.

The layout was originally strongly inspired by the best ctf maps in sauer: reissen and forge, although it has changed quite a lot over time.\n\nFusion is a symmetrical diagonal map over 3 floors. It works very well in insta/effic ctf 3v3 and 4v4.

Work on this map began when one day on a random coop-edit server, I was joking about how it seemed no one had ever tried stuffing a map inside a pyramid, even though I'm sure every mapper has built a pyramid at some point. Someone replied that it was a dumb idea, so I went ahead and did it. The original aim was for the layout to play a bit like Fatum's tumwalk. In some ways, this is still visible in the final map. At first, I made fast progress, but soon after, the map began collecting dust in a \"mostly-finished-but-not-quite-yet\" state for many years. After finishing fusion together with shuzo recently, I decided to work on this map for a few more days and get it ready for upload.\n\nThis map requires the full version of SimonOC's Egyptian texture pack (aka \"egypt_soc\"), which was repackaged for Sauerbraten and uploaded to Quadropolis by RaZgRiZ. The latest version of the texture pack is included in the main download. However, I have provided an alternative download link without the texture pack if you already have it and do not wish to download it again.\n\nNow, some preview shots and facts about the map:\n- The yellow armor is on a raised platform near the ground floor; a hole in the ceiling allows players to drop down onto it from the room above.\n- The healthboost is located on the highest platform, accessible via the spiral path up along the top section or the big jumppad below\n- On the ground floor of the pyramid, the quaddamage spawns on a sarcophagus located between two rows of pillars. It is accessible from all sides (similar to tumwalk's healthboost), which means you need a good plan and the right timing to obtain it without taking too much damage.\n- The green armor has been placed in a location with more cover, but you'll still need to watch out for rifles and rockets.\n- There are three riflerounds and grenades, and two of each other ammo pickup, which is a bit more sparse than other comparable maps. On the other hand, there are six health pickups, so managing your health correctly will provide a big advantage.\n\nMy main concerns that I would appreciate feedback on are:\n- Clipping errors and anything else related to mapping that I may have forgotten about.\n- The ceiling above the yellow armor is thin enough for rocket splash damage to pass through, which might make the room above less useful than I had intended it to be.\n- There is no easy way to the top floor from the side with the two-way teleport and GA.\n- The top floor is not only hard to access, but also doesn't offer many items, which might make it rather weak in general.\n\nThat being said, of course any comments or feedback are welcome.\n\nTL;DR\nFFA duel map. Download anubis.zip, unzip into your Sauerbraten user folder. Enjoy.\n\nMain Download: anubis.zip (14.5 MB)\nNo texture pack: anubis-no-texpack.zip (2.5 MB)\n\nRating\n124\npoints\n (13 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

It was inspired by fusion and a few layouts made by Redon and Shuzomi. Needless to say, when I first started on the map, it was bad, like really bad, but Gangler was the first person who had a look at the map and helped me change a lot on the map regarding the flow and adding platforms or closing unused sections. My first thank you goes out to Gangler for being there from the first shit layout to where it is now. With that being said, very big thank you to Gangler. After Gangler went from having no hope to seeing potental in the map, he was able to get Redon involved and man, we spent a lot of time working on this map and I honestly could not have done this without all the help from both Gangler and Redon. Redon, this map would not be this awesome without your help and a even bigger thank you goes out to you.\n\nWhat can I say about the map, it started out as just a platform and I started to get ideas from looking at other maps that were being worked on, and a lot of ideas came from the map that inspired me to work on this (fusion). There was lava at the bottom of the map, but Zoocata told me to get rid of it within 5 seconds of looking at the map lol. Thank you Zoocata, I took your advice and got rid of it. I also had a few good ideas and some help from Shuzomi, with a few tweaks here and there to not have just plain looking floors, but some depth in them using a few stairs and that in turn also added to it looking better so a thank you to you as well Shuzomi. Redon suggested using a different set of textures to use on the map and we decided on using the \"eX\" texture pack by Yves Allaire, taking inspiration from how it was used by rabe on his map stahlbox. The map works for all ctf modes, and also has some capture bases.\n\nLayout by FixxxerSA, with help from Gangler and Redon\nDetails & Texturing by FixxxerSA and Redon\nItem placement by Redon and Gangler\nLighting by Redon\n\nI hope you all enjoy this map as much as we enjoyed making it!\n\nScreenshots:\n\nThe flag is located in an open room that offers several ways to escape.\n\nBelow each base is a green armor, a teleport to the middle level and a path into the middle. Not in view is the jumppad that allows you to attack the flag from behind.\n\nThe straight corridor in bottom section is divided by an \"asgard\" force field that you can pass through but not shoot through (exception: grenades). Use it to your advantage!\n\nOn the left side of the base, you can find a yellow armor and a way up to the bridge on the top level.\n\nThe other side offers another green armor and a stairway down to the bottom level.\n\nThis map requires the \"eX\" texture pack by Yves Allaire, which is not included in the download!\nIf you've downloaded the Sauerworld map pack before, you should already have it installed.\n\nDownload: collide.zip\n\nMap file fix-quadropolis.txt (20 bytes)\nURL https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xE3xG5DeLRhLrKJ1EuFVyRBqRnzePS5Q\nRating\n85\npoints\n (9 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

The yellow armor is placed just at the end of the centrical jumppad, wich always teleports you on the yellow armor and then launches you to the upper floor.\nThe quad damage is accessible from 5 or 6 ways, you can use grenade jumps or even rifle jumps wich are the faster ways and you can use the jumppad wich is slighty slower. (It’s the only jumppad with 2 big red lamps)\n\nWaltz could work for FFA duels or Effic, but it's still hard to find and kill your enemy even when the map is very open, and it's still an interesting map for good insta players as you can develop some good shots and tricks using jumppads and teleports.\nI would like to thanks Redon for his feedback with the pickup placements and also thanks Notas, Rotti, and Master for all the playtest we did.\n\nFeedback/critics/opinions are always welcome.\n\nFull map including textures: Download\nOnly the map (Includes 1 sound file): Download\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe textures were taken from:\nhttp://quadropolis.us/node/3163\n\nNote: There are some robotic arms located in the background next to the big moving jumppad, it was made by Pyccna in some unreleased map we made. He also made a animated mapmodel but i didn't included this as it has some texture errors, so i did copy/paste to fill that space.\n\nRating\n54\npoints\n (6 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

This map only has two textures: a yellow one and skytexture. But with this, a lot of patterns are created which are used to make platforms, pillars, and wall decorations. I was really excited when I found out that by replacing the yellow texture by a white one, and changing up my color gradient script, that I could color such a map with a color gradient. (instead of just placing down colored cubes which I had done previously)\n\nEver since I found out about this I wanted to create my own map which I could color gradient. I started by creating lots of patterns and soon Gerwin, Ao1|PointBlank, ISMC|TristamK, and AriKani all helped me with this to create a very detailed race map with lots of patterns which I could color. Thanks for all the help guys, I couldn't have done this all by myself. I'm really glad how this turned out!\n\nThere are two versions of this map. The colored one you see in the screenshots, 'babylon'.

A parkour fest\nScreenshot \nGet original file (221KB)\nDetailed description\n\nAfter a LOOONG hiatus from map-making, here's my latest release. Breaking from the \"core_\" themes of previous maps, Deadworld takes place in a future scenario where nature has been all but eliminated, water is deadly to the touch, and anybody with sanity has long ago uploaded themselves from this environment. Only the Ironsnouts remain (or whatever player you choose), and they hasten their demise by struggling over the final scarce resource: flags.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on how to improve gameplay/aesthetics. With my last maps, I made them far too large and open. This time I tried to give plenty of options for movement, while discouraging campers by blocking strategic vantagepoints or making them exposed. I also really stretched the philipk textureset. Speaking of, you'll need this package to properly load the textures: http://quadropolis.us/node/3163\n\nLicense: free to use/modify for non-commercial use, and with credit given to the author\n\nThings I haven't done:\n-lighting: I accidentally did all the lighting with alpha=160 on my monitor. Not sure how to fix the result, since ambient or skylight don't do the trick. Open to suggestions\n-ents: I didn't bother putting in shells, bullets, playerstarts for FFA, etc.. Insta CTF is my favorite format. Now that all the lights and playerstarts are in place, I'm not sure how to make a bunch of new ents and copy/reflect them (since N selects all ents). Again, please tell me\n-textures: I used texcolor to indicate each side, but a bunch of textures are green on both sides. I'm concerned about load-time if I duplicate basically the entire texture set with magenta coloring\n-periphery: most of the detailing is in the playable areas. The outsides are pretty bare\n\nEnjoy the map! Let me know what to fix; I've forgotten a lot of editing tricks in the last decade. And, don't take a swim.\n\nURL https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QOeLGStXyyTyYI_tomUhQI-WGcJsj_Sp\nRating\n44\npoints\n (5 votes)\nlogin to post comments",

Also, I would be happy if you leave me a comment and give me some feedback.\n\nMore important for me is to thank everyone who helped me during the map devolpment. I worked more than 100 hours on this map and I improved very much in most aspects of editing because I got so many tips from so many players. And even more important than tips are people who are trying to help you in the field.\nThanks for helping me Redon, fatality, Nieb, fixxxer and shuzo! :)\n\nRedon helped me from the beginning to the end. He started with teaching me bascis (from making a grid to post this post :D) and supported me all the time until now. He helped me a lot with texturing, clipping and lighting. Sry for all the questions and pms you got from me, Redon. I hope that I was not too annoying.\nfatality helped me with the tunnel, the bottom, the big wall and many other things. Also, he always had some nice words left for me and the map to motivate me to finish this project.\nNieb designed all the windows and helped me with filling the holes in my map. Also he helped me with fixing minor things and Im very thankful for his work.\nfixxxer had the idea with the hole in the wall and other details. He motivated me also with his well-known superfriendly personality and supported me always when he had the chance to look at my map.\nShuzo designed the four pillars in the middle of the map, he improved one floor and designed the part outside that you can see if you look out of a window.\n\nThank you very much guys.\n\nGangler\n\nUpdate - 30th September 2019\n- I changed the size of the Thumbnail.

По сравнению со своим прародителем движок игры был значительно улучшен и неоднократно переработан и со временем в проекте появилось полностью динамическое освещение. \n\nПрисоеденяйся -> https://vk.com/cube_engine_news\n\nEnglish:\n\nGreetings!\n\nFor a long time there has been a group in the Russian-language social network \"Vk\" which dedicated to the active and comprehensive coverage of news regarding Cub 2 Sauerbraten and the Cube engine and its forks in particular.\n\nActually, this topic appeared here to announce that We are still active and are still actively publishing news, after a little \"rebranding\" (:D). We publish 3 new posts every week, and we try to make the content as diverse as possible.\n\nWe are also an official group (at least the first creator of the group called it that) dedicated to Red Eclipse - a cross-platform first-person shooter on the Cube 2 Sauerbraten engine in the style of Unreal Tournament, but with an advanced parkour system. Compared to its ancestor, the game engine has been significantly improved and repeatedly redesigned and over time, the project has fully dynamic lighting.\n\nJoin -> https://vk.com/cube_engine_news\n\n‹ Crying, remembering all of the great memories...15 years later...
